          <div class="fullcommenttop" id="comment"><div class="comment cmt"><p>A suite of tests. A <code>Suite</code> instance encapsulates a conceptual
suite (<em>i.e.</em>, a collection) of tests.</p><p>This trait provides an interface that allows suites of tests to be run.
Its implementation enables a default way of writing and executing tests.  Subtraits and subclasses can
override <code>Suite</code>'s methods to enable other ways of writing and executing tests.
This trait's default approach allows tests to be defined as methods whose name starts with &quot;<code>test</code>.&quot;
This approach is easy to understand, and a good way for Scala beginners to start writing tests.
More advanced Scala programmers may prefer to mix together other <code>Suite</code> subtraits defined in ScalaTest,
or create their own, to write tests in the way they feel makes them most productive. Here's a quick overview
of some of the options to help you get started:</p><p><em>For JUnit 3 users</em></p><p>If you are using JUnit 3 (version 3.8 or earlier releases) and you want to write JUnit 3 tests in Scala, look at
<a href="junit/AssertionsForJUnit.html"><code>AssertionsForJUnit</code></a>,
<a href="junit/ShouldMatchersForJUnit.html"><code>ShouldMatchersForJUnit</code></a>, and
<a href="junit/JUnit3Suite.html"><code>JUnit3Suite</code></a>.</p><p><em>For JUnit 4 users</em></p><p>If you are using JUnit 4 and you want to write JUnit 4 tests in Scala, look at
<a href="junit/JUnitSuite.html"><code>JUnitSuite</code></a>, and
<a href="junit/JUnitRunner.html"><code>JUnitRunner</code></a>. With <code>JUnitRunner</code>,
you can use any of the traits described here and still run your tests with JUnit 4.</p><p><em>For TestNG users</em></p><p>If you are using TestNG and you want to write TestNG tests in Scala, look at
<a href="testng/TestNGSuite.html"><code>TestNGSuite</code></a>.</p><p><em>For high-level testing</em></p><p>If you want to write tests at a higher level than unit tests, such as integration tests, acceptance tests,
or functional tests, check out <a href="FeatureSpec.html"><code>FeatureSpec</code></a>.</p><p><em>For unit testing</em></p><p>If you prefer a behavior-driven development (BDD) style, in which tests are combined with text that
specifies the behavior being tested, look at
<a href="Spec.html"><code>Spec</code></a>,
<a href="FlatSpec.html"><code>FlatSpec</code></a>,
<a href="FreeSpec.html"><code>FreeSpec</code></a>, and
<a href="WordSpec.html"><code>WordSpec</code></a>. Otherwise, if you just want to write tests
and don't want to combine testing with specifying, look at
<a href="FunSuite.html"><code>FunSuite</code></a> or read on to learn how to write
tests using this base trait, <code>Suite</code>.</p><p>To use this trait's approach to writing tests, simply create classes that
extend <code>Suite</code> and define test methods. Test methods have names of the form <code>testX</code>,
where <code>X</code> is some unique, hopefully meaningful, string. A test method must be public and
can have any result type, but the most common result type is <code>Unit</code>. Here's an example:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.Suite
<br /><span class="stReserved">class</span> <span class="stType">ExampleSuite</span> <span class="stReserved">extends</span> <span class="stType">Suite</span> {
<br />  <span class="stReserved">def</span> testAddition {
    <span class="stReserved">val</span> sum = <span class="stLiteral">1</span> + <span class="stLiteral">1</span>
    assert(sum === <span class="stLiteral">2</span>)
  }
<br />  <span class="stReserved">def</span> testSubtraction {
    <span class="stReserved">val</span> diff = <span class="stLiteral">4</span> - <span class="stLiteral">1</span>
    assert(diff === <span class="stLiteral">3</span>)
  }
}
</pre></p><p>You can run a <code>Suite</code> by invoking <code>execute</code> on it.
This method, which prints test results to the standard output, is intended to serve as a
convenient way to run tests from within the Scala interpreter. For example,
to run <code>ExampleSuite</code> from within the Scala interpreter, you could write:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).execute()
</pre></p><p>And you would see:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
<span class="stGreen">ExampleSuite:
- testAddition
- testSubtraction</span>
</pre></p><p>Or, to run just the <code>testAddition</code> method, you could write:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).execute(&quot;testAddition&quot;)
</pre></p><p>And you would see:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
<span class="stGreen">ExampleSuite:
- testAddition</span>
</pre></p><p>You can also pass to <code>execute</code> a <a href="#configMapSection"><em>config map</em></a> of key-value
pairs, which will be passed down into suites and tests, as well as other parameters that configure the run itself.
For more information on running in the Scala interpreter, see the documentation for <code>execute</code> (below) and the
<a href="Shell.html">ScalaTest shell</a>.</code></p><p>The <code>execute</code> method invokes a <code>run</code> method takes seven
parameters. This <code>run</code> method, which actually executes the suite, will usually be invoked by a test runner, such
as <code>org.scalatest.tools.Runner</code> or an IDE. See the <a href="tools/Runner$.html">documentation
for <code>Runner</code></a> for more details.</p><h4> Assertions and <code>=</code><code>=</code><code>=</code> </h4><p>Inside test methods in a <code>Suite</code>, you can write assertions by invoking <code>assert</code> and passing in a <code>Boolean</code> expression,
such as:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">val</span> left = <span class="stLiteral">2</span>
<span class="stReserved">val</span> right = <span class="stLiteral">1</span>
assert(left == right)
</pre></p><p>If the passed expression is <code>true</code>, <code>assert</code> will return normally. If <code>false</code>,
<code>assert</code> will complete abruptly with a <code>TestFailedException</code>. This exception is usually not caught
by the test method, which means the test method itself will complete abruptly by throwing the <code>TestFailedException</code>. Any
test method that completes abruptly with an exception is considered a failed
test. A test method that returns normally is considered a successful test.</p><p>If you pass a <code>Boolean</code> expression to <code>assert</code>, a failed assertion will be reported, but without
reporting the left and right values. You can alternatively encode these values in a <code>String</code> passed as
a second argument to <code>assert</code>, as in:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">val</span> left = <span class="stLiteral">2</span>
<span class="stReserved">val</span> right = <span class="stLiteral">1</span>
assert(left == right, left + <span class="stQuotedString">&quot; did not equal &quot;</span> + right)
</pre></p><p>Using this form of <code>assert</code>, the failure report will include the left and right values,
helping you debug the problem. However, ScalaTest provides the <code>===</code> operator to make this easier.
(The <code>===</code> operator is defined in trait <a href="Assertions.html"><code>Assertions</code></a> which trait <code>Suite</code> extends.)
You use it like this:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">val</span> left = <span class="stLiteral">2</span>
<span class="stReserved">val</span> right = <span class="stLiteral">1</span>
assert(left === right)
</pre></p><p>Because you use <code>===</code> here instead of <code>==</code>, the failure report will include the left
and right values. For example, the detail message in the thrown <code>TestFailedException</code> from the <code>assert</code>
shown previously will include, &quot;2 did not equal 1&quot;.
From this message you will know that the operand on the left had the value 2, and the operand on the right had the value 1.</p><p>If you're familiar with JUnit, you would use <code>===</code>
in a ScalaTest <code>Suite</code> where you'd use <code>assertEquals</code> in a JUnit <code>TestCase</code>.
The <code>===</code> operator is made possible by an implicit conversion from <code>Any</code>
to <code>Equalizer</code>. If you're curious to understand the mechanics, see the <a href="Assertions$Equalizer.html">documentation for
<code>Equalizer</code></a> and the <code>convertToEqualizer</code> method.</p><h4> Expected results </h4><p>Although <code>===</code> provides a natural, readable extension to Scala's <code>assert</code> mechanism,
as the operands become lengthy, the code becomes less readable. In addition, the <code>===</code> comparison
doesn't distinguish between actual and expected values. The operands are just called <code>left</code> and <code>right</code>,
because if one were named <code>expected</code> and the other <code>actual</code>, it would be difficult for people to
remember which was which. To help with these limitations of assertions, <code>Suite</code> includes a method called <code>expect</code> that
can be used as an alternative to <code>assert</code> with <code>===</code>. To use <code>expect</code>, you place
the expected value in parentheses after <code>expect</code>, followed by curly braces containing code
that should result in the expected value. For example:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">val</span> a = <span class="stLiteral">5</span>
<span class="stReserved">val</span> b = <span class="stLiteral">2</span>
expect(<span class="stLiteral">2</span>) {
  a - b
}
</pre></p><p>In this case, the expected value is <code>2</code>, and the code being tested is <code>a - b</code>. This expectation will fail, and
the detail message in the <code>TestFailedException</code> will read, &quot;Expected 2, but got 3.&quot;</p><h4> Intercepted exceptions </h4><p>Sometimes you need to test whether a method throws an expected exception under certain circumstances, such
as when invalid arguments are passed to the method. You can do this in the JUnit style, like this:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">val</span> s = <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;hi&quot;</span>
<span class="stReserved">try</span> {
  s.charAt(-<span class="stLiteral">1</span>)
  fail()
}
<span class="stReserved">catch</span> {
  <span class="stReserved">case</span> _: <span class="stType">IndexOutOfBoundsException</span> =&gt; <span class="stLineComment">// Expected, so continue</span>
}
</pre></p><p>If <code>charAt</code> throws <code>IndexOutOfBoundsException</code> as expected, control will transfer
to the catch case, which does nothing. If, however, <code>charAt</code> fails to throw an exception,
the next statement, <code>fail()</code>, will be executed. The <code>fail</code> method always completes abruptly with
a <code>TestFailedException</code>, thereby signaling a failed test.</p><p>To make this common use case easier to express and read, ScalaTest provides an <code>intercept</code>
method. You use it like this:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">val</span> s = <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;hi&quot;</span>
intercept[<span class="stType">IndexOutOfBoundsException</span>] {
  s.charAt(-<span class="stLiteral">1</span>)
}
</pre></p><p>This code behaves much like the previous example. If <code>charAt</code> throws an instance of <code>IndexOutOfBoundsException</code>,
<code>intercept</code> will return that exception. But if <code>charAt</code> completes normally, or throws a different
exception, <code>intercept</code> will complete abruptly with a <code>TestFailedException</code>. The <code>intercept</code> method returns the
caught exception so that you can inspect it further if you wish, for example, to ensure that data contained inside
the exception has the expected values. Here's an example:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">val</span> s = <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;hi&quot;</span>
<span class="stReserved">val</span> caught =
  intercept[<span class="stType">IndexOutOfBoundsException</span>] {
    s.charAt(-<span class="stLiteral">1</span>)
  }
assert(caught.getMessage === <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;String index out of range: -1&quot;</span>)
</pre></p><h4> Using other assertions </h4><p>ScalaTest also supports another style of assertions via its matchers DSL. By mixing in
trait <a href="matchers/ShouldMatchers.html"><code>ShouldMatchers</code></a>, you can
write suites that look like:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.Suite
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.matchers.ShouldMatchers
<br /><span class="stReserved">class</span> <span class="stType">ExampleSuite</span> <span class="stReserved">extends</span> <span class="stType">Suite</span> <span class="stReserved">with</span> <span class="stType">ShouldMatchers</span> {
<br />  <span class="stReserved">def</span> testAddition {
    <span class="stReserved">val</span> sum = <span class="stLiteral">1</span> + <span class="stLiteral">1</span>
    sum should equal (<span class="stLiteral">2</span>)
  }
<br />  <span class="stReserved">def</span> testSubtraction {
    <span class="stReserved">val</span> diff = <span class="stLiteral">4</span> - <span class="stLiteral">1</span>
    diff should equal (<span class="stLiteral">3</span>)
  }
}
</pre></p><p>If you prefer the word &quot;<code>must</code>&quot; to the word &quot;<code>should</code>,&quot; you can alternatively mix in
trait <a href="matchers/MustMatchers.html"><code>MustMatchers</code></a>.</p><p>If you are comfortable with assertion mechanisms from other test frameworks, chances
are you can use them with ScalaTest. Any assertion mechanism that indicates a failure with an exception
can be used as is with ScalaTest. For example, to use the <code>assertEquals</code>
methods provided by JUnit or TestNG, simply import them and use them. (You will of course need
to include the relevant JAR file for the framework whose assertions you want to use on either the
classpath or runpath when you run your tests.) Here's an example in which JUnit's assertions are
imported, then used within a ScalaTest suite:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.Suite
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.junit.Assert._
<br /><span class="stReserved">class</span> <span class="stType">ExampleSuite</span> <span class="stReserved">extends</span> <span class="stType">Suite</span> {
<br />  <span class="stReserved">def</span> testAddition {
    <span class="stReserved">val</span> sum = <span class="stLiteral">1</span> + <span class="stLiteral">1</span>
    assertEquals(<span class="stLiteral">2</span>, sum)
  }
<br />  <span class="stReserved">def</span> testSubtraction {
    <span class="stReserved">val</span> diff = <span class="stLiteral">4</span> - <span class="stLiteral">1</span>
    assertEquals(<span class="stLiteral">3</span>, diff)
  }
}
</pre></p><h4> Nested suites </h4><p>A <code>Suite</code> can refer to a collection of other <code>Suite</code>s,
which are called <em>nested</em> <code>Suite</code>s. Those nested  <code>Suite</code>s can in turn have
their own nested  <code>Suite</code>s, and so on. Large test suites can be organized, therefore, as a tree of
nested <code>Suite</code>s.
This trait's <code>run</code> method, in addition to invoking its
test methods, invokes <code>run</code> on each of its nested <code>Suite</code>s.</p><p>A <code>List</code> of a <code>Suite</code>'s nested <code>Suite</code>s can be obtained by invoking its
<code>nestedSuites</code> method. If you wish to create a <code>Suite</code> that serves as a
container for nested <code>Suite</code>s, whether or not it has test methods of its own, simply override <code>nestedSuites</code>
to return a <code>List</code> of the nested <code>Suite</code>s. Because this is a common use case, ScalaTest provides
a convenience <code>Suites</code> class, which takes a variable number of nested <code>Suite</code>s as constructor
parameters. Here's an example:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.Suite
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.Suites
<br /><span class="stReserved">class</span> <span class="stType">ASuite</span> <span class="stReserved">extends</span> <span class="stType">Suite</span> {
  <span class="stReserved">def</span> testA {}
}
<span class="stReserved">class</span> <span class="stType">BSuite</span> <span class="stReserved">extends</span> <span class="stType">Suite</span> {
  <span class="stReserved">def</span> testB {}
}
<span class="stReserved">class</span> <span class="stType">CSuite</span> <span class="stReserved">extends</span> <span class="stType">Suite</span> {
  <span class="stReserved">def</span> testC {}
}
<br /><span class="stReserved">class</span> <span class="stType">AlphabetSuite</span> <span class="stReserved">extends</span> <span class="stType">Suites</span>(
  <span class="stReserved">new</span> <span class="stType">ASuite</span>,
  <span class="stReserved">new</span> <span class="stType">BSuite</span>,
  <span class="stReserved">new</span> <span class="stType">CSuite</span>
)
</pre></p><p>If you now run <code>AlphabetSuite</code>:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new AlphabetSuite).execute()
</pre></p><p>You will see reports printed to the standard output that indicate the nested
suites&#8212;<code>ASuite</code>, <code>BSuite</code>, and
<code>CSuite</code>&#8212;were run:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
<span class="stGreen">AlphabetSuite:
ASuite:
- testA
BSuite:
- testB
CSuite:
- testC</span>
</pre></p><p>Note that <code>Runner</code> can discover <code>Suite</code>s automatically, so you need not
necessarily define nested <code>Suites</code> explicitly. See the <a href="tools/Runner$.html$membersOnlyWildcard">documentation
for <code>Runner</code></a> for more information.</p><p><a name="configMapSection"> </a></p><h4> The config map </h4><p>In some cases you may need to pass information to a suite of tests.
For example, perhaps a suite of tests needs to grab information from a file, and you want
to be able to specify a different filename during different runs.  You can accomplish this in ScalaTest by passing
the filename in a <em>config map</em> of key-value pairs, which is passed to <code>run</code> as a <code>Map[String, Any]</code>.
The values in the config map are called &quot;config objects,&quot; because they can be used to <em>configure</em>
suites, reporters, and tests.</p><p>You can specify a string config object is via the ScalaTest <code>Runner</code>, either via the command line
or ScalaTest's ant task.
(See the <a href="tools/Runner$.html#configMapSection">documentation for Runner</a> for information on how to specify
config objects on the command line.)
The config map is passed to <code>run</code>, <code>runNestedSuites</code>, <code>runTests</code>, and <code>runTest</code>,
so one way to access it in your suite is to override one of those methods. If you need to use the config map inside your tests, you
can access it from the <code>NoArgTest</code> passed to <code>withFixture</code>, or the <code>OneArgTest</code> passed to
<code>withFixture</code> in the traits in the <code>org.scalatest.fixture</code> package. (See the
<a href="fixture/FixtureSuite.html">documentation for <code>FixtureSuite</code></a>
for instructions on how to access the config map in tests.)</p><h4> Ignored tests </h4><p>Another common use case is that tests must be &#8220;temporarily&#8221; disabled, with the
good intention of resurrecting the test at a later time. ScalaTest provides an <code>Ignore</code>
annotation for this purpose. You use it like this:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.Suite
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.Ignore
<br /><span class="stReserved">class</span> <span class="stType">ExampleSuite</span> <span class="stReserved">extends</span> <span class="stType">Suite</span> {
<br />  <span class="stReserved">def</span> testAddition {
    <span class="stReserved">val</span> sum = <span class="stLiteral">1</span> + <span class="stLiteral">1</span>
    assert(sum === <span class="stLiteral">2</span>)
  }
<br />  @<span class="stType">Ignore</span>
  <span class="stReserved">def</span> testSubtraction {
    <span class="stReserved">val</span> diff = <span class="stLiteral">4</span> - <span class="stLiteral">1</span>
    assert(diff === <span class="stLiteral">3</span>)
  }
}
</pre></p><p>If you run this version of <code>ExampleSuite</code> with:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).run()
</pre></p><p>It will run only <code>testAddition</code> and report that <code>testSubtraction</code> was ignored. You'll see:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
<span class="stGreen">ExampleSuite:
- testAddition</span>
<span class="stYellow">- testSubtraction !!! IGNORED !!!</span>
</pre></p><p><code>Ignore</code> is implemented as a tag. The <code>Filter</code> class effectively
adds <code>org.scalatest.Ignore</code> to the <code>tagsToExclude</code> <code>Set</code> if it not already
in the <code>tagsToExclude</code> set passed to its primary constructor.  The only difference between
<code>org.scalatest.Ignore</code> and the tags you may define and exclude is that ScalaTest reports
ignored tests to the <code>Reporter</code>. The reason ScalaTest reports ignored tests is
to encourage ignored tests to be eventually fixed and added back into the active suite of tests.</p><h4> Pending tests </h4><p>A <em>pending test</em> is one that has been given a name but is not yet implemented. The purpose of
pending tests is to facilitate a style of testing in which documentation of behavior is sketched
out before tests are written to verify that behavior (and often, before the behavior of
the system being tested is itself implemented). Such sketches form a kind of specification of
what tests and functionality to implement later.</p><p>To support this style of testing, a test can be given a name that specifies one
bit of behavior required by the system being tested. The test can also include some code that
sends more information about the behavior to the reporter when the tests run. At the end of the test,
it can call method <code>pending</code>, which will cause it to complete abruptly with <code>TestPendingException</code>.</p><p>Because tests in ScalaTest can be designated as pending with <code>TestPendingException</code>, both the test name and any information
sent to the reporter when running the test can appear in the report of a test run. (In other words,
the code of a pending test is executed just like any other test.) However, because the test completes abruptly
with <code>TestPendingException</code>, the test will be reported as pending, to indicate
the actual test, and possibly the functionality it is intended to test, has not yet been implemented.</p><p>Although pending tests may be used more often in specification-style suites, such as
<code>org.scalatest.Spec</code>, you can also use it in <code>Suite</code>, like this:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.Suite
<br /><span class="stReserved">class</span> <span class="stType">ExampleSuite</span> <span class="stReserved">extends</span> <span class="stType">Suite</span> {
<br />  <span class="stReserved">def</span> testAddition {
    <span class="stReserved">val</span> sum = <span class="stLiteral">1</span> + <span class="stLiteral">1</span>
    assert(sum === <span class="stLiteral">2</span>)
  }
<br />  <span class="stReserved">def</span> testSubtraction { pending }
}
</pre></p><p>If you run this version of <code>ExampleSuite</code> with:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).run()
</pre></p><p>It will run both tests but report that <code>testSubtraction</code> is pending. You'll see:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
<span class="stGreen">ExampleSuite:
- testAddition</span>
<span class="stYellow">- testSubtraction (pending)</span>
</pre></p><h4> Informers </h4><p>One of the parameters to <code>run</code> is a <code>Reporter</code>, which
will collect and report information about the running suite of tests.
Information about suites and tests that were run, whether tests succeeded or failed,
and tests that were ignored will be passed to the <code>Reporter</code> as the suite runs.
Most often the reporting done by default by <code>Suite</code>'s methods will be sufficient, but
occasionally you may wish to provide custom information to the <code>Reporter</code> from a test method.
For this purpose, you can optionally include an <code>Informer</code> parameter in a test method, and then
pass the extra information to the <code>Informer</code> via its <code>apply</code> method. The <code>Informer</code>
will then pass the information to the <code>Reporter</code> by sending an <code>InfoProvided</code> event.
Here's an example:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest._
<br /><span class="stReserved">class</span> <span class="stType">ExampleSuite</span> <span class="stReserved">extends</span> <span class="stType">Suite</span> {
<br />  <span class="stReserved">def</span> testAddition(info: <span class="stType">Informer</span>) {
    assert(<span class="stLiteral">1</span> + <span class="stLiteral">1</span> === <span class="stLiteral">2</span>)
    info(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;Addition seems to work&quot;</span>)
  }
}
</pre></p><p>If you run this <code>Suite</code> from the interpreter, you will see the message
included in the printed report:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).run()
<span class="stGreen">ExampleSuite:
- testAddition(Informer)
  + Addition seems to work </span>
</pre></p><h4> Executing suites in parallel </h4><p>The <code>run</code> method takes as one of its parameters an optional <code>Distributor</code>. If
a <code>Distributor</code> is passed in, this trait's implementation of <code>run</code> puts its nested
<code>Suite</code>s into the distributor rather than executing them directly. The caller of <code>run</code>
is responsible for ensuring that some entity runs the <code>Suite</code>s placed into the
distributor. The <code>-c</code> command line parameter to <code>Runner</code>, for example, will cause
<code>Suite</code>s put into the <code>Distributor</code> to be run in parallel via a pool of threads.</p><p><a name="TaggingTests"> </a></p><h4> Tagging tests </h4><p>A <code>Suite</code>'s tests may be classified into groups by <em>tagging</em> them with string names. When executing
a <code>Suite</code>, groups of tests can optionally be included and/or excluded. In this
trait's implementation, tags are indicated by annotations attached to the test method. To
create a new tag type to use in <code>Suite</code>s, simply define a new Java annotation that itself is annotated with the <code>org.scalatest.TagAnnotation</code> annotation.
(Currently, for annotations to be
visible in Scala programs via Java reflection, the annotations themselves must be written in Java.) For example,
to create a tag named <code>SlowAsMolasses</code>, to use to mark slow tests, you would
write in Java:</p><p><b>Because of a Scaladoc bug in Scala 2.8, I had to put a space after the at sign in one the target annotation example below. If you
want to copy and paste from this example, you'll need to remove the space by hand.  - Bill Venners</b></p><p><pre>
import java.lang.annotation.*;
import org.scalatest.TagAnnotation

@TagAnnotation
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@ Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.TYPE})
public @interface SlowAsMolasses {}
</pre></p><p>Given this new annotation, you could place a <code>Suite</code> test method into the <code>SlowAsMolasses</code> group
(<em>i.e.</em>, tag it as being <code>SlowAsMolasses</code>) like this:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
@<span class="stType">SlowAsMolasses</span>
<span class="stReserved">def</span> testSleeping { sleep(<span class="stLiteral">1000000</span>) }
</pre></p><p>The <code>run</code> method takes a <code>Filter</code>, whose constructor takes an optional
<code>Set[String]</code> called <code>tagsToInclude</code> and a <code>Set[String]</code> called
<code>tagsToExclude</code>. If <code>tagsToInclude</code> is <code>None</code>, all tests will be run
except those those belonging to tags listed in the
<code>tagsToExclude</code> <code>Set</code>. If <code>tagsToInclude</code> is defined, only tests
belonging to tags mentioned in the <code>tagsToInclude</code> set, and not mentioned in <code>tagsToExclude</code>,
will be run.</p><p><a name="sharedFixtures"> </a></p><h4> Shared fixtures </h4><p>A test <em>fixture</em> is objects or other artifacts (such as files, sockets, database
connections, <em>etc.</em>) used by tests to do their work.
If a fixture is used by only one test method, then the definitions of the fixture objects can
be local to the method, such as the objects assigned to <code>sum</code> and <code>diff</code> in the
previous <code>ExampleSuite</code> examples. If multiple methods need to share an immutable fixture, one approach
is to assign them to instance variables.</p><p>In some cases, however, shared <em>mutable</em> fixture objects may be changed by test methods such that
they need to be recreated or reinitialized before each test. Shared resources such
as files or database connections may also need to
be created and initialized before, and cleaned up after, each test. JUnit 3 offered methods <code>setUp</code> and
<code>tearDown</code> for this purpose. In ScalaTest, you can use the <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> trait,
which will be described later, to implement an approach similar to JUnit's <code>setUp</code>
and <code>tearDown</code>, however, this approach usually involves reassigning <code>var</code>s or mutating objects
between tests. Before going that route, you may wish to consider some more functional approaches that
avoid side effects.</p><h6> Calling create-fixture methods </h6><p>One approach is to write one or more <em>create-fixture</em> methods
that return a new instance of a needed fixture object (or an holder object containing multiple needed fixture objects) each time it
is called. You can then call a create-fixture method at the beginning of each
test method that needs the fixture, storing the returned object or objects in local variables. Here's an example:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">

      <span class="stReserved">val</span> buffer = <span class="stReserved">new</span> <span class="stType">ListBuffer[String]</span>
    }
<br />  <span class="stReserved">def</span> testEasy {
    <span class="stReserved">val</span> f = fixture
    f.builder.append(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;easy!&quot;</span>)
    assert(f.builder.toString === <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;ScalaTest is easy!&quot;</span>)
    assert(f.buffer.isEmpty)
    f.buffer += <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;sweet&quot;</span>
  }
<br />  <span class="stReserved">def</span> testFun {
    <span class="stReserved">val</span> f = fixture
    f.builder.append(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;fun!&quot;</span>)
    assert(f.builder.toString === <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;ScalaTest is fun!&quot;</span>)
    assert(f.buffer.isEmpty)
  }
}
</pre></p><p>The &ldquo;<code>f.</code>&rdquo; in front of each use of a fixture object provides a visual indication of which objects
are part of the fixture, but if you prefer, you can import the the members with &ldquo;<code>import f._</code>&rdquo; and use the names directly.</p><h6> Instantiating fixture traits </h6><p>A related technique is to place
the fixture objects in a <em>fixture trait</em> and run your test code in the context of a new anonymous class instance that mixes in
the fixture trait, like this:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.Suite
<span class="stReserved">import</span> collection.mutable.ListBuffer

    <span class="stReserved">val</span> buffer = <span class="stReserved">new</span> <span class="stType">ListBuffer[String]</span>
  }
<br />  <span class="stReserved">def</span> testEasy {
    <span class="stReserved">new</span> <span class="stType">Fixture</span> {
      builder.append(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;easy!&quot;</span>)
      assert(builder.toString === <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;ScalaTest is easy!&quot;</span>)
      assert(buffer.isEmpty)
      buffer += <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;sweet&quot;</span>
    }
  }
<br />  <span class="stReserved">def</span> testFun {
    <span class="stReserved">new</span> <span class="stType">Fixture</span> {
      builder.append(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;fun!&quot;</span>)
      assert(builder.toString === <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;ScalaTest is fun!&quot;</span>)
      assert(buffer.isEmpty)
    }
  }
}
</pre></p><h6> Mixing in <code>OneInstancePerTest</code> </h6><p>If every test method requires the same set of
mutable fixture objects, one other approach you can take is make them simply <code>val</code>s and mix in trait
<a href="OneInstancePerTest.html"><code>OneInstancePerTest</code></a>.  If you mix in <code>OneInstancePerTest</code>, each test
will be run in its own instance of the <code>Suite</code>, similar to the way JUnit tests are executed. Here's an example:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.Suite
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.OneInstancePerTest

<br />  <span class="stReserved">val</span> builder = <span class="stReserved">new</span> <span class="stType">StringBuilder</span>(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;ScalaTest is &quot;</span>)
  <span class="stReserved">val</span> buffer = <span class="stReserved">new</span> <span class="stType">ListBuffer[String]</span>
<br />  <span class="stReserved">def</span> testEasy {
    builder.append(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;easy!&quot;</span>)
    assert(builder.toString === <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;ScalaTest is easy!&quot;</span>)
    assert(buffer.isEmpty)
    buffer += <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;sweet&quot;</span>
  }
<br />  <span class="stReserved">def</span> testFun {
    builder.append(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;fun!&quot;</span>)
    assert(builder.toString === <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;ScalaTest is fun!&quot;</span>)
    assert(buffer.isEmpty)
  }
}
</pre></p><p>Although the create-fixture, fixture-trait, and <code>OneInstancePerTest</code> approaches take care of setting up a fixture before each
test, they don't address the problem of cleaning up a fixture after the test completes. In this situation, you'll need to either
use side effects or the <em>loan pattern</em>.</p><h6> Mixing in <code>BeforeAndAfter</code> </h6><p>One way to use side effects is to mix in the <a href="BeforeAndAfter.html"><code>BeforeAndAfter</code></a> trait.
With this trait you can denote a bit of code to run before each test with <code>before</code> and/or after each test
each test with <code>after</code>, like this:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.Suite
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.BeforeAndAfter
<span class="stReserved">import</span> collection.mutable.ListBuffer

<br />  <span class="stReserved">val</span> builder = <span class="stReserved">new</span> <span class="stType">StringBuilder</span>
  <span class="stReserved">val</span> buffer = <span class="stReserved">new</span> <span class="stType">ListBuffer[String]</span>
<br />  before {
    builder.append(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;ScalaTest is &quot;</span>)
  }
<br />  after {
    builder.clear()
    buffer.clear()
  }
<br />  <span class="stReserved">def</span> testEasy {
    builder.append(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;easy!&quot;</span>)
    assert(builder.toString === <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;ScalaTest is easy!&quot;</span>)
    assert(buffer.isEmpty)
    buffer += <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;sweet&quot;</span>
  }
<br />  <span class="stReserved">def</span> testFun {
    builder.append(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;fun!&quot;</span>)
    assert(builder.toString === <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;ScalaTest is fun!&quot;</span>)
    assert(buffer.isEmpty)
  }
}
</pre></p><h6> Overriding <code>withFixture(NoArgTest)</code> </h6><p>An alternate way to take care of setup and cleanup via side effects
is to override <code>withFixture</code>. Trait <code>Suite</code>'s implementation of
<code>runTest</code> passes a no-arg test function to <code>withFixture</code>. It is <code>withFixture</code>'s
responsibility to invoke that test function.  <code>Suite</code>'s implementation of <code>withFixture</code> simply
invokes the function, like this:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stLineComment">// Default implementation</span>
<span class="stReserved">protected</span> <span class="stReserved">def</span> withFixture(test: <span class="stType">NoArgTest</span>) {
  test()
}
</pre></p><p>You can, therefore, override <code>withFixture</code> to perform setup before, and cleanup after, invoking the test function. If
you have cleanup to perform, you should invoke the test function
inside a <code>try</code> block and perform the cleanup in a <code>finally</code> clause.
Here's an example:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.Suite
<span class="stReserved">import</span> collection.mutable.ListBuffer
<br /><span class="stReserved">class</span> <span class="stType">ExampleSuite</span> <span class="stReserved">extends</span> <span class="stType">Suite</span> {
<br />  <span class="stReserved">val</span> builder = <span class="stReserved">new</span> <span class="stType">StringBuilder</span>
  <span class="stReserved">val</span> buffer = <span class="stReserved">new</span> <span class="stType">ListBuffer[String]</span>
<br />  <span class="stReserved">override</span> <span class="stReserved">def</span> withFixture(test: <span class="stType">NoArgTest</span>) {
    builder.append(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;ScalaTest is &quot;</span>) <span class="stLineComment">// perform setup</span>
    <span class="stReserved">try</span> {
      test() <span class="stLineComment">// invoke the test function</span>
    }
    <span class="stReserved">finally</span> {
      builder.clear() <span class="stLineComment">// perform cleanup</span>
      buffer.clear()
    }
  }
<br />  <span class="stReserved">def</span> testEasy {
    builder.append(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;easy!&quot;</span>)
    assert(builder.toString === <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;ScalaTest is easy!&quot;</span>)
    assert(buffer.isEmpty)
    buffer += <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;sweet&quot;</span>
  }
<br />  <span class="stReserved">def</span> testFun {
    builder.append(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;fun!&quot;</span>)
    assert(builder.toString === <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;ScalaTest is fun!&quot;</span>)
    assert(buffer.isEmpty)
    buffer += <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;clear&quot;</span>
  }
}
</pre></p><p>Note that the <a href="Suite$NoArgTest.html"><code>NoArgTest</code></a> passed to <code>withFixture</code>, in addition to
an <code>apply</code> method that executes the test, also includes the test name as well as the <a href="#configMapSection">config
map</a> passed to <code>runTest</code>. Thus you can also use the test name and configuration objects in <code>withFixture</code>.</p><p>The reason you should perform cleanup in a <code>finally</code> clause is that <code>withFixture</code> is called by
<code>runTest</code>, which expects an exception to be thrown to indicate a failed test. Thus when you invoke
the <code>test</code> function inside <code>withFixture</code>, it may complete abruptly with an exception. The <code>finally</code>
clause will ensure the fixture cleanup happens as that exception propagates back up the call stack to <code>runTest</code>.</p><h6> Overriding <code>withFixture(OneArgTest)</code> </h6><p>To use the loan pattern, you can extend <code>FixtureSuite</code> (from the <code>org.scalatest.fixture</code> package) instead of
<code>Suite</code>. Each test in a <code>FixtureSuite</code> takes a fixture as a parameter, allowing you to pass the fixture into
the test. You must indicate the type of the fixture parameter by specifying <code>FixtureParam</code>, and implement a
<code>withFixture</code> method that takes a <code>OneArgTest</code>. This <code>withFixture</code> method is responsible for
invoking the one-arg test function, so you can perform fixture set up before, and clean up after, invoking and passing
the fixture into the test function. Here's an example:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">

a <code>new Builder</code>, whereas <code>testReadable</code> uses only the <code>ListBuffer</code> fixture, so it just intantiates
a <code>new Buffer</code>. <code>testFriendly</code> needs just the <code>FileWriter</code> fixture, so it invokes
<code>withWriter</code>, which prepares and passes a <code>FileWriter</code> to the test (and takes care of closing it afterwords).</p><p>Two tests need multiple fixtures: <code>testClearAndConcise</code> needs both the <code>StringBuilder</code> and the
<code>ListBuffer</code>, so it instantiates a class that mixes in both fixture traits with <code>new Builder with Buffer</code>.
<code>testComposable</code> needs all three fixtures, so in addition to <code>new Builder with Buffer</code> it also invokes
<code>withWriter</code>, wrapping just the of the test code that needs the fixture.</p><p>Note that in this case, the loan pattern is being implemented via the <code>withWriter</code> method that takes a function, not
by overriding <code>FixtureSuite</code>'s <code>withFixture(OneArgTest)</code> method. <code>FixtureSuite</code> makes the most sense
if all (or at least most) tests need the same fixture, whereas in this <code>Suite</code> only two tests need the
<code>FileWriter</code>.</p><p>Note also that two test methods, <code>testFriendly</code> and <code>testComposable</code>, are declared as parameterless methods even
though they have a side effect. In production code you would normally declare these as <em>empty-paren</em> methods, and call them with
empty parentheses, to make it more obvious to readers of the code that they have a side effect. Whether or not a test method has
a side effect, however, is a less important distinction than it is for methods in production code. Moreover, test methods are not
normally invoked directly by client code, but rather through reflection by running the <code>Suite</code> that contains them, so a
lack of parentheses on an invocation of a side-effecting test method would not normally appear in any client code. Given the empty
parentheses do not add much value in the test methods case, the recommended style is to simply always leave them off.</p><p>In the previous example, the <code>withWriter</code> method passed an object into
the tests. Passing fixture objects into tests is generally a good idea when possible, but sometimes a side affect is unavoidable.
For example, if you need to initialize a database running on a server across a network, your with-fixture
method will likely have nothing to pass. In such cases, simply create a with-fixture method that takes a by-name parameter and
performs setup and cleanup via side effects, like this:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">def</span> withDataInDatabase(test: =&gt; <span class="stType">Any</span>) {
  <span class="stLineComment">// initialize the database across the network</span>

  }
  <span class="stReserved">finally</span> {
    <span class="stLineComment">// clean up the database</span>
  }
}
</pre></p><p>You can then use it like:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">def</span> testUserLogsIn {
  withDataInDatabase {
    <span class="stLineComment">// test user logging in scenario</span>

and possibly initialized (and cleaned up) in different orders. A good way to accomplish this in ScalaTest is to factor the individual
fixtures into traits that can be composed using the <em>stackable trait</em> pattern. This can be done, for example, by placing
<code>withFixture</code> methods in several traits, each of which call <code>super.withFixture</code>. Here's an example in
which the <code>StringBuilder</code> and <code>ListBuffer[String]</code> fixtures used in the previous examples have been
factored out into two <em>stackable fixture traits</em> named <code>Builder</code> and <code>Buffer</code>:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">

</pre></p><p>By mixing in both the <code>Builder</code> and <code>Buffer</code> traits, <code>ExampleSuite</code> gets both fixtures, which will be
initialized before each test and cleaned up after. The order the traits are mixed together determines the order of execution.
In this case, <code>Builder</code> is &quot;super&quot; to </code>Buffer</code>. If you wanted <code>Buffer</code> to be &quot;super&quot;
to <code>Builder</code>, you need only switch the order you mix them together, like this:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">class</span> <span class="stType">Example2Suite</span> <span class="stReserved">extends</span> <span class="stType">Suite</span> <span class="stReserved">with</span> <span class="stType">Buffer</span> <span class="stReserved">with</span> <span class="stType">Builder</span>
</pre></p><p>And if you only need one fixture you mix in only that trait:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">class</span> <span class="stType">Example3Suite</span> <span class="stReserved">extends</span> <span class="stType">Suite</span> <span class="stReserved">with</span> <span class="stType">Builder</span>
</pre></p><p>Another way to create stackable fixture traits is by extending the <a href="BeforeAndAfterEach.html"><code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code></a>
and/or <a href="BeforeAndAfterAll.html"><code>BeforeAndAfterAll</code></a> traits.
<code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> has a <code>beforeEach</code> method that will be run before each test (like JUnit's <code>setUp</code>),
and an <code>afterEach</code> method that will be run after (like JUnit's <code>tearDown</code>).
Similarly, <code>BeforeAndAfterAll</code> has a <code>beforeAll</code> method that will be run before all tests,
and an <code>afterAll</code> method that will be run after all tests. Here's what the previously shown example would look like if it
were rewritten to use the <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> methods instead of <code>withFixture</code>:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">

<code>beforeEach</code> method, and the <code>super.afterEach</code> call at the beginning of each <code>afterEach</code>
method, as shown in the previous example. It is a good idea to invoke <code>super.afterEach</code> in a <code>try</code>
block and perform cleanup in a <code>finally</code> clause, as shown in the previous example, because this ensures the
cleanup code is performed even if <code>super.afterAll</code> throws an exception.</p><p>One difference to bear in mind between the before-and-after traits and the <code>withFixture</code> methods, is that if
a <code>withFixture</code> method completes abruptly with an exception, it is considered a failed test. By contrast, if any of the
methods on the before-and-after traits (<em>i.e.</em>, <code>before</code>  and <code>after</code> of <code>BeforeAndAfter</code>,
<code>beforeEach</code> and <code>afterEach</code> of <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code>,
and <code>beforeAll</code> and <code>afterAll</code> of <code>BeforeAndAfterAll</code>) complete abruptly, it is considered a
failed suite, which will result in a <a href="events/SuiteAborted.html"><code>SuiteAborted</code></a> event.</p><p><a name="errorHandling"> </a></p><h4> Treatment of <code>java.lang.Error</code>s </h4><p>The Javadoc documentation for <code>java.lang.Error</code> states:</p><p><blockquote>
An <code>Error</code> is a subclass of <code>Throwable</code> that indicates serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch. Most
such errors are abnormal conditions.
</blockquote></p><p>Because <code>Error</code>s are used to denote serious errors, trait <code>Suite</code> and its subtypes in the ScalaTest API do not always treat a test
that completes abruptly with an <code>Error</code> as a test failure, but sometimes as an indication that serious problems
have arisen that should cause the run to abort. For example, if a test completes abruptly with an <code>OutOfMemoryError</code>,
it will not be reported as a test failure, but will instead cause the run to abort. Because not everyone uses <code>Error</code>s only to represent serious
problems, however, ScalaTest only behaves this way for the following exception types (and their subclasses):</p><ul><li><code>java.lang.annotation.AnnotationFormatError</code></li><li><code>java.awt.AWTError</code></li><li><code>java.nio.charset.CoderMalfunctionError</code></li><li><code>javax.xml.parsers.FactoryConfigurationError</code></li><li><code>java.lang.LinkageError</code></li><li><code>java.lang.ThreadDeath</code></li><li><code>javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactoryConfigurationError</code></li><li><code>java.lang.VirtualMachineError</code></li></ul><p>The previous list includes all <code>Error</code>s that exist as part of Java 1.5 API, excluding <code>java.lang.AssertionError</code>. ScalaTest
does treat a thrown <code>AssertionError</code> as an indication of a test failure. In addition, any other <code>Error</code> that is not an instance of a
type mentioned in the previous list will be caught by the <code>Suite</code> traits in the ScalaTest API and reported as the cause of a test failure.</p><p>Although trait <code>Suite</code> and all its subtypes in the ScalaTest API consistently behave this way with regard to <code>Error</code>s,
this behavior is not required by the contract of <code>Suite</code>. Subclasses and subtraits that you define, for example, may treat all
<code>Error</code>s as test failures, or indicate errors in some other way that has nothing to do with exceptions.</p><h4> Extensibility </h4><p>Trait <code>Suite</code> provides default implementations of its methods that should
be sufficient for most applications, but many methods can be overridden when desired. Here's
a summary of the methods that are intended to be overridden:</p><ul><li><code>run</code> - override this method to define custom ways to run suites of
  tests.</li><li><code>runNestedSuites</code> - override this method to define custom ways to run nested suites.</li><li><code>runTests</code> - override this method to define custom ways to run a suite's tests.</li><li><code>runTest</code> - override this method to define custom ways to run a single named test.</li><li><code>testNames</code> - override this method to specify the <code>Suite</code>'s test names in a custom way.</li><li><code>tags</code> - override this method to specify the <code>Suite</code>'s test tags in a custom way.</li><li><code>nestedSuites</code> - override this method to specify the <code>Suite</code>'s nested <code>Suite</code>s in a custom way.</li><li><code>suiteName</code> - override this method to specify the <code>Suite</code>'s name in a custom way.</li><li><code>expectedTestCount</code> - override this method to count this <code>Suite</code>'s expected tests in a custom way.</li></ul><p>For example, this trait's implementation of <code>testNames</code> performs reflection to discover methods starting with <code>test</code>,
and places these in a <code>Set</code> whose iterator returns the names in alphabetical order. If you wish to run tests in a different
order in a particular <code>Suite</code>, perhaps because a test named <code>testAlpha</code> can only succeed after a test named
<code>testBeta</code> has run, you can override <code>testNames</code> so that it returns a <code>Set</code> whose iterator returns
<code>testBeta</code> <em>before</em> <code>testAlpha</code>. (This trait's implementation of <code>run</code> will invoke tests
in the order they come out of the <code>testNames</code> <code>Set</code> iterator.)</p><p>Alternatively, you may not like starting your test methods with <code>test</code>, and prefer using <code>@Test</code> annotations in
the style of Java's JUnit 4 or TestNG. If so, you can override <code>testNames</code> to discover tests using either of these two APIs
<code>@Test</code> annotations, or one of your own invention. (This is in fact
how <code>org.scalatest.junit.JUnitSuite</code> and <code>org.scalatest.testng.TestNGSuite</code> work.)</p><p>Moreover, <em>test</em> in ScalaTest does not necessarily mean <em>test method</em>. A test can be anything that can be given a name,
that starts and either succeeds or fails, and can be ignored. In <code>org.scalatest.FunSuite</code>, for example, tests are represented
as function values. This
approach might look foreign to JUnit users, but may feel more natural to programmers with a functional programming background.
To facilitate this style of writing tests, <code>FunSuite</code> overrides <code>testNames</code>, <code>runTest</code>, and <code>run</code> such that you can
define tests as function values.</p><p>You can also model existing JUnit 3, JUnit 4, or TestNG tests as suites of tests, thereby incorporating tests written in Java into a ScalaTest suite.
The &quot;wrapper&quot; classes in packages <code>org.scalatest.junit</code> and <code>org.scalatest.testng</code> exist to make this easy.
No matter what legacy tests you may have, it is likely you can create or use an existing <code>Suite</code> subclass that allows you to model those tests
as ScalaTest suites and tests and incorporate them into a ScalaTest suite. You can then write new tests in Scala and continue supporting
older tests in Java.</p></div><dl class="attributes block"> <dt>Self Type</dt><dd><a name="org.scalatest.Suite" class="extype" href="">Suite</a></dd><dt>Annotations</dt><dd>

available by default in ScalaTest <code>Suite</code>s. This is the only implicit conversion that is in scope by default in every
ScalaTest <code>Suite</code>. Other implicit conversions offered by ScalaTest, such as those that support the matchers DSL
or <code>invokePrivate</code>, must be explicitly invited into your test code, either by mixing in a trait or importing the
members of its companion object. The reason ScalaTest requires you to invite in implicit conversions (with the exception of the
implicit conversion for <code>===</code> operator)  is because if one of ScalaTest's implicit conversions clashes with an
implicit conversion used in the code you are trying to test, your program won't compile. Thus there is a chance that if you
are ever trying to use a library or test some code that also offers an implicit conversion involving a <code>===</code> operator,
you could run into the problem of a compiler error due to an ambiguous implicit conversion. If that happens, you can turn off
the implicit conversion offered by this <code>convertToEqualizer</code> method simply by overriding the method in your
<code>Suite</code> subclass, but not marking it as implicit:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">

method, all of which have default values. This behavior is convenient when working with ScalaTest in the Scala interpreter.
Here's a summary of this method's parameters and how you can use them:</p><p><strong>The <code>testName</code> parameter</strong></p><p>If you leave <code>testName</code> at its default value (of <code>null</code>), this method will pass <code>None</code> to
the <code>testName</code> parameter of <code>run</code>, and as a result all the tests in this suite will be executed. If you
specify a <code>testName</code>, this method will pass <code>Some(testName)</code> to <code>run</code>, and only that test
will be run. Thus to run all tests in a suite from the Scala interpreter, you can write:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).execute()
</pre></p><p>To run just the test named <code>"my favorite test"</code> in a suite from the Scala interpreter, you would write:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).execute(&quot;my favorite test&quot;)
</pre></p><p>Or:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).execute(testName = &quot;my favorite test&quot;)
</pre></p><p><strong>The <code>configMap</code> parameter</strong></p><p>If you provide a value for the <code>configMap</code> parameter, this method will pass it to <code>run</code>. If not, the default value
of an empty <code>Map</code> will be passed. For more information on how to use a config map to configure your test suites, see
the <a href="#configMapSection">config map section</a> in the main documentation for this trait. Here's an example in which you configure
a run with the name of an input file:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).execute(configMap = Map(&quot;inputFileName&quot; -&gt; &quot;in.txt&quot;)
</pre></p><p><strong>The <code>color</code> parameter</strong></p><p>If you leave the <code>color</code> parameter unspecified, this method will configure the reporter it passes to <code>run</code> to print
to the standard output in color (via ansi escape characters). If you don't want color output, specify false for <code>color</code>, like this:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).execute(color = false)
</pre></p><p><strong>The <code>durations</code> parameter</strong></p><p>If you leave the <code>durations</code> parameter unspecified, this method will configure the reporter it passes to <code>run</code> to
<em>not</em> print durations for tests and suites to the standard output. If you want durations printed, specify true for <code>durations</code>,
like this:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).execute(durations = true)
</pre></p><p><strong>The <code>shortstacks</code> and <code>fullstacks</code> parameters</strong></p><p>If you leave both the <code>shortstacks</code> and <code>fullstacks</code> parameters unspecified, this method will configure the reporter
it passes to <code>run</code> to <em>not</em> print stack traces for failed tests if it has a stack depth that identifies the offending
line of test code. If you prefer a short stack trace (10 to 15 stack frames) to be printed with any test failure, specify true for
<code>shortstacks</code>:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).execute(shortstacks = true)
</pre></p><p>For full stack traces, set <code>fullstacks</code> to true:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).execute(fullstacks = true)
</pre></p><p>If you specify true for both <code>shortstacks</code> and <code>fullstacks</code>, you'll get full stack traces.</p><p><strong>The <code>stats</code> parameter</strong></p><p>If you leave the <code>stats</code> parameter unspecified, this method will <em>not</em> fire <code>RunStarting</code> and either <code>RunCompleted</code>
or <code>RunAborted</code> events to the reporter it passes to <code>run</code>.
If you specify true for <code>stats</code>, this method will fire the run events to the reporter, and the reporter will print the
expected test count before the run, and various statistics after, including the number of suites completed and number of tests that
succeeded, failed, were ignored or marked pending. Here's how you get the stats:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).execute(stats = true)
</pre></p><p>To summarize, this method will pass to <code>run</code>:</p><ul><li><code>testName</code> - <code>None</code> if this method's <code>testName</code> parameter is left at its default value of <code>null</code>, else <code>Some(testName)</code>.</li><li><code>reporter</code> - a reporter that prints to the standard output</li><li><code>stopper</code> - a <code>Stopper</code> whose <code>apply</code> method always returns <code>false</code></li><li><code>filter</code> - a <code>Filter</code> constructed with <code>None</code> for <code>tagsToInclude</code> and <code>Set()</code>
  for <code>tagsToExclude</code></li><li><code>configMap</code> - the <code>configMap</code> passed to this method</li><li><code>distributor</code> - <code>None</code></li><li><code>tracker</code> - a new <code>Tracker</code></li></ul><p>Note:  In ScalaTest, the terms &quot;execute&quot; and &quot;run&quot; basically mean the same thing and
can be used interchangably. The reason this method isn't named <code>run</code> is that it takes advantage of
default arguments, and you can't mix overloaded methods and default arguments in Scala. (If named <code>run</code>,
this method would have the same name but different arguments than the main <a href="#run"><code>run</code> method</a> that
takes seven arguments. Thus it would overload and couldn't be used with default argument values.)</p><p>Design note: This method has two &quot;features&quot; that may seem unidiomatic. First, the default value of <code>testName</code> is <code>null</code>.
Normally in Scala the type of <code>testName</code> would be <code>Option[String]</code> and the default value would
be <code>None</code>, as it is in this trait's <code>run</code> method. The <code>null</code> value is used here for two reasons. First, in
ScalaTest 1.5, <code>execute</code> was changed from four overloaded methods to one method with default values, taking advantage of
the default and named parameters feature introduced in Scala 2.8.
To not break existing source code, <code>testName</code> needed to have type <code>String</code>, as it did in two of the overloaded
<code>execute</code> methods prior to 1.5. The other reason is that <code>execute</code> has always been designed to be called primarily
from an interpeter environment, such as the Scala REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop). In an interpreter environment, minimizing keystrokes is king.
A <code>String</code> type with a <code>null</code> default value lets users type <code>suite.execute("my test name")</code> rather than
<code>suite.execute(Some("my test name"))</code>, saving several keystrokes.</p><p>The second non-idiomatic feature is that <code>shortstacks</code> and <code>fullstacks</code> are all lower case rather than
camel case. This is done to be consistent with the <a href="Shell.html"><code>Shell</code></a>, which also uses those forms. The reason
lower case is used in the <code>Shell</code> is to save keystrokes in an interpreter environment.  Most Unix commands, for
example, are all lower case, making them easier and quicker to type.  In the ScalaTest
<code>Shell</code>, methods like <code>shortstacks</code>, <code>fullstacks</code>, and <code>nostats</code>, <em>etc.</em>, are
designed to be all lower case so they feel more like shell commands than methods.</p></div><dl class="paramcmts block"><dt class="param">testName</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>the name of one test to run.</p></dd><dt class="param">configMap</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>a <code>Map</code> of key-value pairs that can be used by the executing <code>Suite</code> of tests.</p></dd><dt class="param">color</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>a boolean that configures whether output is printed in color</p></dd><dt class="param">durations</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>a boolean that configures whether test and suite durations are printed to the standard output</p></dd><dt class="param">shortstacks</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>a boolean that configures whether short stack traces should be printed for test failures</p></dd><dt class="param">fullstacks</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>a boolean that configures whether full stack traces should be printed for test failures</p></dd><dt class="param">stats</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>a boolean that configures whether test and suite statistics are printed to the standard output

The purpose of
pending tests is to facilitate a style of testing in which documentation of behavior is sketched
out before tests are written to verify that behavior (and often, the before the behavior of
the system being tested is itself implemented). Such sketches form a kind of specification of
what tests and functionality to implement later.</p><p>To support this style of testing, a test can be given a name that specifies one
bit of behavior required by the system being tested. The test can also include some code that
sends more information about the behavior to the reporter when the tests run. At the end of the test,
it can call method <code>pending</code>, which will cause it to complete abruptly with <code>TestPendingException</code>.
Because tests in ScalaTest can be designated as pending with <code>TestPendingException</code>, both the test name and any information
sent to the reporter when running the test can appear in the report of a test run. (In other words,
the code of a pending test is executed just like any other test.) However, because the test completes abruptly
with <code>TestPendingException</code>, the test will be reported as pending, to indicate
the actual test, and possibly the functionality it is intended to test, has not yet been implemented.</p><p>Note: This method always completes abruptly with a <code>TestPendingException</code>. Thus it always has a side
effect. Methods with side effects are usually invoked with parentheses, as in <code>pending()</code>. This
method is defined as a parameterless method, in flagrant contradiction to recommended Scala style, because it
forms a kind of DSL for pending tests. It enables tests in suites such as <code>FunSuite</code> or <code>Spec</code>
to be denoted by placing &quot;<code>(pending)</code>&quot; after the test name, as in:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
test(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;that style rules are not laws&quot;</span>) (pending)
</pre></p><p>Readers of the code see &quot;pending&quot; in parentheses, which looks like a little note attached to the test name to indicate
it is pending. Whereas &quot;<code>(pending())</code> looks more like a method call, &quot;<code>(pending)</code>&quot; lets readers
stay at a higher level, forgetting how it is implemented and just focusing on the intent of the programmer who wrote the code.</p></div></div>

throw <code>TestFailedException</code>.</p><p>This method can be used to temporarily change a failing test into a pending test in such a way that it will
automatically turn back into a failing test once the problem originally causing the test to fail has been fixed.
At that point, you need only remove the <code>pendingUntilFixed</code> call. In other words, a
<code>pendingUntilFixed</code> surrounding a block of code that isn't broken is treated as a test failure.
The motivation for this behavior is to encourage people to remove <code>pendingUntilFixed</code> calls when
there are no longer needed.</p><p>This method facilitates a style of testing in which tests are written before the code they test. Sometimes you may
encounter a test failure that requires more functionality than you want to tackle without writing more tests. In this
case you can mark the bit of test code causing the failure with <code>pendingUntilFixed</code>. You can then write more
tests and functionality that eventually will get your production code to a point where the original test won't fail anymore.
At this point the code block marked with <code>pendingUntilFixed</code> will no longer throw an exception (because the
problem has been fixed). This will in turn cause <code>pendingUntilFixed</code> to throw <code>TestFailedException</code>
with a detail message explaining you need to go back and remove the <code>pendingUntilFixed</code> call as the problem orginally
causing your test code to fail has been fixed.</p></div><dl class="paramcmts block"><dt class="param">f</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>a block of code, which if it completes abruptly, should trigger a <code>TestPendingException</code></p></dd></dl></div>

calls <code>runTests</code>, but does not call <code>runNestedSuites</code>. This behavior
is part of the contract of this method. Subclasses that override <code>run</code> must take
care not to call <code>runNestedSuites</code> if <code>testName</code> is defined. (The
<code>OneInstancePerTest</code> trait depends on this behavior, for example.)</p><p>Subclasses and subtraits that override this <code>run</code> method can implement them without
invoking either the <code>runTests</code> or <code>runNestedSuites</code> methods, which
are invoked by this trait's implementation of this method. It is recommended, but not required,
that subclasses and subtraits that override <code>run</code> in a way that does not

final. Similarly it is recommended, but not required,
that subclasses and subtraits that override <code>run</code> in a way that does not

which this trait's implementation of <code>runTests</code> calls) and make it

of the method, or throw an <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code> if appropriate. The
reason for this recommendation is that ScalaTest includes several traits that override
these methods to allow behavior to be mixed into a <code>Suite</code>. For example, trait
<code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> overrides <code>runTests</code>s. In a <code>Suite</code>
subclass that no longer invokes <code>runTests</code> from <code>run</code>, the
<code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> trait is not applicable. Mixing it in would have no effect.
By making <code>runTests</code> final in such a <code>Suite</code> subtrait, you make
the attempt to mix <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> into a subclass of your subtrait
a compiler error. (It would fail to compile with a complaint that <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code>
is trying to override <code>runTests</code>, which is a final method in your trait.)</p></div><dl class="paramcmts block"><dt class="param">testName</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>an optional name of one test to run. If <code>None</code>, all relevant tests should be run.

If <code>testName</code> is defined, this trait's implementation of this method
invokes <code>runTest</code> on this object, passing in:</p><ul><li><code>testName</code> - the <code>String</code> value of the <code>testName</code> <code>Option</code> passed
  to this method</li><li><code>reporter</code> - the <code>Reporter</code> passed to this method, or one that wraps and delegates to it</li><li><code>stopper</code> - the <code>Stopper</code> passed to this method, or one that wraps and delegates to it</li><li><code>configMap</code> - the <code>configMap</code> <code>Map</code> passed to this method, or one that wraps and delegates to it</li></ul><p>This method takes a <code>Filter</code>, which encapsulates an optional <code>Set</code> of tag names that should be included
(<code>tagsToInclude</code>) and a <code>Set</code> that should be excluded (<code>tagsToExclude</code>), when deciding which
of this <code>Suite</code>'s tests to run.
If <code>tagsToInclude</code> is <code>None</code>, all tests will be run
except those those belonging to tags listed in the <code>tagsToExclude</code> <code>Set</code>. If <code>tagsToInclude</code> is defined, only tests
belonging to tags mentioned in the <code>tagsToInclude</code> <code>Set</code>, and not mentioned in the <code>tagsToExclude</code <code>Set</code>
will be run. However, if <code>testName</code> is defined, <code>tagsToInclude</code> and <code>tagsToExclude</code> are essentially ignored.
Only if <code>testName</code> is <code>None</code> will <code>tagsToInclude</code> and <code>tagsToExclude</code> be consulted to
determine which of the tests named in the <code>testNames</code> <code>Set</code> should be run. This trait's implementation
behaves this way, and it is part of the general contract of this method, so all overridden forms of this method should behave
this way as well.  For more information on test tags, see the main documentation for this trait and for class <a href="Filter"><code>Filter</code></a>.
Note that this means that even if a test is marked as ignored, for example a test method in a <code>Suite</code> annotated with
<code>org.scalatest.Ignore</code>, if that test name is passed as <code>testName</code> to <code>runTest</code>, it will be invoked
despite the <code>Ignore</code> annotation.</p><p>If <code>testName</code> is <code>None</code>, this trait's implementation of this method
invokes <code>testNames</code> on this <code>Suite</code> to get a <code>Set</code> of names of tests to potentially run.
(A <code>testNames</code> value of <code>None</code> essentially acts as a wildcard that means all tests in
this <code>Suite</code> that are selected by <code>tagsToInclude</code> and <code>tagsToExclude</code> should be run.)
For each test in the <code>testName</code> <code>Set</code>, in the order
they appear in the iterator obtained by invoking the <code>elements</code> method on the <code>Set</code>, this trait's implementation
of this method checks whether the test should be run based on the <code>Filter</code>.
If so, this implementation invokes <code>runTest</code>, passing in:</p><ul><li><code>testName</code> - the <code>String</code> name of the test to run (which will be one of the names in the <code>testNames</code> <code>Set</code>)</li><li><code>reporter</code> - the <code>Reporter</code> passed to this method, or one that wraps and delegates to it</li><li><code>stopper</code> - the <code>Stopper</code> passed to this method, or one that wraps and delegates to it</li><li><code>configMap</code> - the <code>configMap</code> passed to this method, or one that wraps and delegates to it</li></ul><p>If a test is marked with the <code>org.scalatest.Ignore</code> tag, implementations
