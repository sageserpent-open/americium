<code>FeatureSpec</code> is intended for writing tests that are &quot;higher level&quot; than unit tests, for example, integration
tests, functional tests, and acceptance tests. You can use <code>FeatureSpec</code> for unit testing if you prefer, however.
Here's an example:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">

      assert(emptyStack.isEmpty)
    }
  }
}
</pre></p><p>A <code>FeatureSpec</code> contains <em>feature clauses</em> and <em>scenarios</em>. You define a feature clause
with <code>feature</code>, and a scenario with <code>scenario</code>. Both
<code>feature</code> and <code>scenario</code> are methods, defined in
<code>FeatureSpec</code>, which will be invoked
by the primary constructor of <code>StackFeatureSpec</code>.
A feature clause describes a feature of the <em>subject</em> (class or other entity) you are specifying
and testing. In the previous example,
the subject under specification and test is a stack. The feature being specified and tested is
the ability for a user (a programmer in this case) to pop an element off the top of the stack. With each scenario you provide a
string (the <em>spec text</em>) that specifies the behavior of the subject for
one scenario in which the feature may be used, and a block of code that tests that behavior.
You place the spec text between the parentheses, followed by the test code between curly
braces.  The test code will be wrapped up as a function passed as a by-name parameter to
<code>scenario</code>, which will register the test for later execution.</p><p>A <code>FeatureSpec</code>'s lifecycle has two phases: the <em>registration</em> phase and the
<em>ready</em> phase. It starts in registration phase and enters ready phase the first time
<code>run</code> is called on it. It then remains in ready phase for the remainder of its lifetime.</p><p>Scenarios can only be registered with the <code>scenario</code> method while the <code>FeatureSpec</code> is
in its registration phase. Any attempt to register a scenario after the <code>FeatureSpec</code> has
entered its ready phase, <em>i.e.</em>, after <code>run</code> has been invoked on the <code>FeatureSpec</code>,
will be met with a thrown <code>TestRegistrationClosedException</code>. The recommended style
of using <code>FeatureSpec</code> is to register tests during object construction as is done in all
the examples shown here. If you keep to the recommended style, you should never see a
<code>TestRegistrationClosedException</code>.</p><p>Each scenario represents one test. The name of the test is the spec text passed to the <code>scenario</code> method.
The feature name does not appear as part of the test name. In a <code>FeatureSpec</code>, therefore, you must take care
to ensure that each test has a unique name (in other words, that each <code>scenario</code> has unique spec text).</p><p>When you run a <code>FeatureSpec</code>, it will send <code>Formatter</code>s in the events it sends to the
<code>Reporter</code>. ScalaTest's built-in reporters will report these events in such a way
that the output is easy to read as an informal specification of the <em>subject</em> being tested.
For example, if you ran <code>StackFeatureSpec</code> from within the Scala interpreter:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new StackFeatureSpec).execute()
</pre></p><p>You would see:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
<span class="stGreen">Feature: The user can pop an element off the top of the stack
  As a programmer
  I want to be able to pop items off the stack
  So that I can get them in last-in-first-out order
  Scenario: pop is invoked on a non-empty stack
    Given a non-empty stack
    When when pop is invoked on the stack
    Then the most recently pushed element should be returned
    And the stack should have one less item than before
  Scenario: pop is invoked on an empty stack
    Given an empty stack
    When when pop is invoked on the stack
    Then NoSuchElementException should be thrown
    And the stack should still be empty</span>

good intention of resurrecting the test at a later time, <code>FeatureSpec</code> provides registration
methods that start with <code>ignore</code> instead of <code>scenario</code>. For example, to temporarily
disable the test named <code>addition</code>, just change &#8220;<code>scenario</code>&#8221; into &#8220;<code>ignore</code>,&#8221; like this:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.FeatureSpec
<br /><span class="stReserved">class</span> <span class="stType">ArithmeticSpec</span> <span class="stReserved">extends</span> <span class="stType">FeatureSpec</span> {
<br />  <span class="stLineComment">// Sharing fixture objects via instance variables</span>
  <span class="stReserved">val</span> shared = <span class="stLiteral">5</span>
<br />  feature(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;Integer arithmetic&quot;</span>) {
<br />    ignore(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;addition&quot;</span>) {
      <span class="stReserved">val</span> sum = <span class="stLiteral">2</span> + <span class="stLiteral">3</span>
      assert(sum === shared)
    }
<br />    scenario(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;subtraction&quot;</span>) {
      <span class="stReserved">val</span> diff = <span class="stLiteral">7</span> - <span class="stLiteral">2</span>
      assert(diff === shared)
    }
  }
}
</pre></p><p>If you run this version of <code>ArithmeticSpec</code> with:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ArithmeticSpec).execute()
</pre></p><p>It will run only <code>subtraction</code> and report that <code>addition</code> was ignored:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
<span class="stGreen">Feature: Integer arithmetic </span>
  <span class="stYellow">Scenario: addition !!! IGNORED !!!</span>
  <span class="stGreen">Scenario: subtraction</span>
</pre></p><h4> Informers </h4><p>One of the parameters to the <code>run</code> method is a <code>Reporter</code>, which
will collect and report information about the running suite of tests.
Information about suites and tests that were run, whether tests succeeded or failed,
and tests that were ignored will be passed to the <code>Reporter</code> as the suite runs.
Most often the reporting done by default by <code>FeatureSpec</code>'s methods will be sufficient, but
occasionally you may wish to provide custom information to the <code>Reporter</code> from a test.
For this purpose, an <code>Informer</code> that will forward information to the current <code>Reporter</code>
is provided via the <code>info</code> parameterless method.
You can pass the extra information to the <code>Informer</code> via its <code>apply</code> method.
The <code>Informer</code> will then pass the information to the <code>Reporter</code> via an <code>InfoProvided</code> event.
Here's an example:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.FeatureSpec

included in the printed report:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
<span class="stGreen">Feature: Integer arithmetic

    Addition seems to work</span>
</pre></p><p>One use case for the <code>Informer</code> is to pass more information about a scenario to the reporter. For example,
the <code>GivenWhenThen</code> trait provides methods that use the implicit <code>info</code> provided by <code>FeatureSpec</code>
to pass such information to the reporter. Here's an example:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.FeatureSpec

  }

</pre></p><h4> Pending tests </h4><p>A <em>pending test</em> is one that has been given a name but is not yet implemented. The purpose of
pending tests is to facilitate a style of testing in which documentation of behavior is sketched
out before tests are written to verify that behavior (and often, before the behavior of
the system being tested is itself implemented). Such sketches form a kind of specification of
what tests and functionality to implement later.</p><p>To support this style of testing, a test can be given a name that specifies one
bit of behavior required by the system being tested. The test can also include some code that
sends more information about the behavior to the reporter when the tests run. At the end of the test,
it can call method <code>pending</code>, which will cause it to complete abruptly with <code>TestPendingException</code>.</p><p>Because tests in ScalaTest can be designated as pending with <code>TestPendingException</code>, both the test name and any information
sent to the reporter when running the test can appear in the report of a test run. (In other words,
the code of a pending test is executed just like any other test.) However, because the test completes abruptly
with <code>TestPendingException</code>, the test will be reported as pending, to indicate
the actual test, and possibly the functionality, has not yet been implemented.
You can mark tests as pending in a <code>FeatureSpec</code> like this:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.FeatureSpec
<br /><span class="stReserved">class</span> <span class="stType">ArithmeticSpec</span> <span class="stReserved">extends</span> <span class="stType">FeatureSpec</span> {
<br />  <span class="stLineComment">// Sharing fixture objects via instance variables</span>
  <span class="stReserved">val</span> shared = <span class="stLiteral">5</span>
<br />  feature(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;Integer arithmetic&quot;</span>) {
<br />    scenario(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;addition&quot;</span>) {
      <span class="stReserved">val</span> sum = <span class="stLiteral">2</span> + <span class="stLiteral">3</span>
      assert(sum === shared)
    }
<br />    scenario(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;subtraction&quot;</span>) (pending)
  }
}
</pre></p><p>(Note: &quot;<code>(pending)</code>&quot; is the body of the test. Thus the test contains just one statement, an invocation
of the <code>pending</code> method, which throws <code>TestPendingException</code>.)
If you run this version of <code>ArithmeticSpec</code> with:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ArithmeticSpec).execute()
</pre></p><p>It will run both tests, but report that <code>subtraction</code> is pending. You'll see:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
<span class="stGreen">Feature: Integer arithmetic
  Scenario: addition</span>
  <span class="stYellow">Scenario: subtraction (pending)</span>
</pre></p><p>One difference between an ignored test and a pending one is that an ignored test is intended to be used during a
significant refactorings of the code under test, when tests break and you don't want to spend the time to fix
all of them immediately. You can mark some of those broken tests as ignored temporarily, so that you can focus the red
bar on just failing tests you actually want to fix immediately. Later you can go back and fix the ignored tests.
In other words, by ignoring some failing tests temporarily, you can more easily notice failed tests that you actually
want to fix. By contrast, a pending test is intended to be used before a test and/or the code under test is written.
Pending indicates you've decided to write a test for a bit of behavior, but either you haven't written the test yet, or
have only written part of it, or perhaps you've written the test but don't want to implement the behavior it tests
until after you've implemented a different bit of behavior you realized you need first. Thus ignored tests are designed
to facilitate refactoring of existing code whereas pending tests are designed to facilitate the creation of new code.</p><p>One other difference between ignored and pending tests is that ignored tests are implemented as a test tag that is
excluded by default. Thus an ignored test is never executed. By contrast, a pending test is implemented as a
test that throws <code>TestPendingException</code> (which is what calling the <code>pending</code> method does). Thus
the body of pending tests are executed up until they throw <code>TestPendingException</code>. The reason for this difference
is that it enables your unfinished test to send <code>InfoProvided</code> messages to the reporter before it completes
abruptly with <code>TestPendingException</code>, as shown in the previous example on <code>Informer</code>s
that used the <code>GivenWhenThen</code> trait. For example, the following snippet in a <code>FeatureSpec</code>:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
feature(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;Integer arithmetic&quot;</span>) {</p><p>    scenario(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;addition&quot;</span>) {
      given(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;two integers&quot;</span>)
      when(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;they are added&quot;</span>)
      then(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;the result is the sum of the two numbers&quot;</span>)
      pending
    }
    <span class="stLineComment">// ...</span>
</pre></p><p>Would yield the following output when run in the interpreter:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
<span class="stGreen">Feature: Integer arithmetic</span>
  <span class="stYellow">Scenario: addition (pending)
    Given two integers
    When they are added
    Then the result is the sum of the two numbers</span>
</pre></p><h4> Tagging tests </h4><p>A <code>FeatureSpec</code>'s tests may be classified into groups by <em>tagging</em> them with string names.
As with any suite, when executing a <code>FeatureSpec</code>, groups of tests can
optionally be included and/or excluded. To tag a <code>FeatureSpec</code>'s tests,
you pass objects that extend abstract class <code>org.scalatest.Tag</code> to methods
that register tests, <code>test</code> and <code>ignore</code>. Class <code>Tag</code> takes one parameter, a string name.  If you have
created Java annotation interfaces for use as group names in direct subclasses of <code>org.scalatest.Suite</code>,
then you will probably want to use group names on your <code>FeatureSpec</code>s that match. To do so, simply
pass the fully qualified names of the Java interfaces to the <code>Tag</code> constructor. For example, if you've
defined Java annotation interfaces with fully qualified names, <code>com.mycompany.tags.SlowTest</code> and
<code>com.mycompany.tags.DbTest</code>, then you could
create matching groups for <code>FeatureSpec</code>s like this:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.Tag
<br /><span class="stReserved">object</span> <span class="stType">SlowTest</span> <span class="stReserved">extends</span> <span class="stType">Tag</span>(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;com.mycompany.tags.SlowTest&quot;</span>)
<span class="stReserved">object</span> <span class="stType">DbTest</span> <span class="stReserved">extends</span> <span class="stType">Tag</span>(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;com.mycompany.tags.DbTest&quot;</span>)
</pre></p><p>Given these definitions, you could place <code>FeatureSpec</code> tests into groups like this:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.FeatureSpec
<br /><span class="stReserved">class</span> <span class="stType">ArithmeticSpec</span> <span class="stReserved">extends</span> <span class="stType">FeatureSpec</span> {
<br />  <span class="stLineComment">// Sharing fixture objects via instance variables</span>
  <span class="stReserved">val</span> shared = <span class="stLiteral">5</span>
<br />  feature(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;Integer arithmetic&quot;</span>) {
<br />    scenario(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;addition&quot;</span>, <span class="stType">SlowTest</span>) {
      <span class="stReserved">val</span> sum = <span class="stLiteral">2</span> + <span class="stLiteral">3</span>
      assert(sum === shared)
    }
<br />    scenario(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;subtraction&quot;</span>, <span class="stType">SlowTest</span>, <span class="stType">DbTest</span>) {
      <span class="stReserved">val</span> diff = <span class="stLiteral">7</span> - <span class="stLiteral">2</span>
      assert(diff === shared)
    }
  }
}
</pre></p><p>This code marks both tests, &quot;addition&quot; and &quot;subtraction,&quot; with the <code>com.mycompany.tags.SlowTest</code> tag,
and test &quot;subtraction&quot; with the <code>com.mycompany.tags.DbTest</code> tag.</p><p>The <code>run</code> method takes a <code>Filter</code>, whose constructor takes an optional
<code>Set[String]</code> called <code>tagsToInclude</code> and a <code>Set[String]</code> called
<code>tagsToExclude</code>. If <code>tagsToInclude</code> is <code>None</code>, all tests will be run
except those those belonging to tags listed in the
<code>tagsToExclude</code> <code>Set</code>. If <code>tagsToInclude</code> is defined, only tests
belonging to tags mentioned in the <code>tagsToInclude</code> set, and not mentioned in <code>tagsToExclude</code>,
will be run.</p><p><a name="sharedFixtures"> </a></p><h4> Shared fixtures </h4><p>A test <em>fixture</em> is objects or other artifacts (such as files, sockets, database
connections, <em>etc.</em>) used by tests to do their work.
If a fixture is used by only one test method, then the definitions of the fixture objects can
be local to the method, such as the objects assigned to <code>sum</code> and <code>diff</code> in the
previous <code>ExampleSpec</code> examples. If multiple methods need to share an immutable fixture, one approach
is to assign them to instance variables.</p><p>In some cases, however, shared <em>mutable</em> fixture objects may be changed by test methods such that
they need to be recreated or reinitialized before each test. Shared resources such
as files or database connections may also need to
be created and initialized before, and cleaned up after, each test. JUnit 3 offered methods <code>setUp</code> and
<code>tearDown</code> for this purpose. In ScalaTest, you can use the <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> trait,
which will be described later, to implement an approach similar to JUnit's <code>setUp</code>
and <code>tearDown</code>, however, this approach usually involves reassigning <code>var</code>s or mutating objects
between tests. Before going that route, you may wish to consider some more functional approaches that
avoid side effects.</p><h6> Calling create-fixture methods </h6><p>One approach is to write one or more <em>create-fixture</em> methods
that return a new instance of a needed fixture object (or an holder object containing multiple needed fixture objects) each time it
is called. You can then call a create-fixture method at the beginning of each
test method that needs the fixture, storing the returned object or objects in local variables. Here's an example:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">

the fixture objects in a <em>fixture trait</em> and run your test code in the context of a new anonymous class instance that mixes in

mutable fixture objects, one other approach you can take is make them simply <code>val</code>s and mix in trait
<a href="OneInstancePerTest.html"><code>OneInstancePerTest</code></a>.  If you mix in <code>OneInstancePerTest</code>, each test
will be run in its own instance of the <code>Suite</code>, similar to the way JUnit tests are executed. Here's an example:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">

use side effects or the <em>loan pattern</em>.</p><h6> Mixing in <code>BeforeAndAfter</code> </h6><p>One way to use side effects is to mix in the <a href="BeforeAndAfter.html"><code>BeforeAndAfter</code></a> trait.

</pre></p><h6> Overriding <code>withFixture(NoArgTest)</code> </h6><p>An alternate way to take care of setup and cleanup via side effects
is to override <code>withFixture</code>. Trait <code>Suite</code>'s implementation of
<code>runTest</code>, which is inherited by this trait, passes a no-arg test function to <code>withFixture</code>. It is <code>withFixture</code>'s
responsibility to invoke that test function.  <code>Suite</code>'s implementation of <code>withFixture</code> simply
invokes the function, like this:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stLineComment">// Default implementation</span>
<span class="stReserved">protected</span> <span class="stReserved">def</span> withFixture(test: <span class="stType">NoArgTest</span>) {
  test()
}
</pre></p><p>You can, therefore, override <code>withFixture</code> to perform setup before, and cleanup after, invoking the test function. If
you have cleanup to perform, you should invoke the test function
inside a <code>try</code> block and perform the cleanup in a <code>finally</code> clause.
Here's an example:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.FeatureSpec
<span class="stReserved">import</span> collection.mutable.ListBuffer

      assert(buffer.isEmpty)
      buffer += <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;sweet&quot;</span>
    }
<br />    scenario(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;user enjoys writing tests with shared fixtures&quot;</span>) {

      assert(buffer.isEmpty)
      buffer += <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;clear&quot;</span>
    }
  }
}
</pre></p><p>Note that the <a href="Suite$NoArgTest.html"><code>NoArgTest</code></a> passed to <code>withFixture</code>, in addition to
an <code>apply</code> method that executes the test, also includes the test name as well as the <a href="Suite.html#configMapSection">config
map</a> passed to <code>runTest</code>. Thus you can also use the test name and configuration objects in <code>withFixture</code>.</p><p>The reason you should perform cleanup in a <code>finally</code> clause is that <code>withFixture</code> is called by
<code>runTest</code>, which expects an exception to be thrown to indicate a failed test. Thus when you invoke
the <code>test</code> function inside <code>withFixture</code>, it may complete abruptly with an exception. The <code>finally</code>
clause will ensure the fixture cleanup happens as that exception propagates back up the call stack to <code>runTest</code>.</p><h6> Overriding <code>withFixture(OneArgTest)</code> </h6><p>To use the loan pattern, you can extend <code>FixtureFeatureSpec</code> (from the <code>org.scalatest.fixture</code> package) instead of
<code>FeatureSpec</code>. Each test in a <code>FixtureFeatureSpec</code> takes a fixture as a parameter, allowing you to pass the fixture into
the test. You must indicate the type of the fixture parameter by specifying <code>FixtureParam</code>, and implement a
<code>withFixture</code> method that takes a <code>OneArgTest</code>. This <code>withFixture</code> method is responsible for
invoking the one-arg test function, so you can perform fixture set up before, and clean up after, invoking and passing
the fixture into the test function. Here's an example:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">

a <code>new Buffer</code>. <code>the test framework is user-friendly</code> needs just the <code>FileWriter</code> fixture, so it invokes
<code>withWriter</code>, which prepares and passes a <code>FileWriter</code> to the test (and takes care of closing it afterwords).</p><p>Two tests need multiple fixtures: <code>test code is clear and concise</code> needs both the <code>StringBuilder</code> and the
<code>ListBuffer</code>, so it instantiates a class that mixes in both fixture traits with <code>new Builder with Buffer</code>.
<code>user composes test artifacts</code> needs all three fixtures, so in addition to <code>new Builder with Buffer</code> it also invokes
<code>withWriter</code>, wrapping just the of the test code that needs the fixture.</p><p>Note that in this case, the loan pattern is being implemented via the <code>withWriter</code> method that takes a function, not
by overriding <code>FixtureFeatureSpec</code>'s <code>withFixture(OneArgTest)</code> method. <code>FixtureFeatureSpec</code> makes the most sense
if all (or at least most) tests need the same fixture, whereas in this <code>Suite</code> only two tests need the
<code>FileWriter</code>.</p><p>In the previous example, the <code>withWriter</code> method passed an object into
the tests. Passing fixture objects into tests is generally a good idea when possible, but sometimes a side affect is unavoidable.
For example, if you need to initialize a database running on a server across a network, your with-fixture
method will likely have nothing to pass. In such cases, simply create a with-fixture method that takes a by-name parameter and
performs setup and cleanup via side effects, like this:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">def</span> withDataInDatabase(test: =&gt; <span class="stType">Any</span>) {

fixtures into traits that can be composed using the <em>stackable trait</em> pattern. This can be done, for example, by placing
<code>withFixture</code> methods in several traits, each of which call <code>super.withFixture</code>. Here's an example in

and/or <a href="BeforeAndAfterAll.html"><code>BeforeAndAfterAll</code></a> traits.
<code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> has a <code>beforeEach</code> method that will be run before each test (like JUnit's <code>setUp</code>),
and an <code>afterEach</code> method that will be run after (like JUnit's <code>tearDown</code>).
Similarly, <code>BeforeAndAfterAll</code> has a <code>beforeAll</code> method that will be run before all tests,

<code>beforeEach</code> method, and the <code>super.afterEach</code> call at the beginning of each <code>afterEach</code>
method, as shown in the previous example. It is a good idea to invoke <code>super.afterEach</code> in a <code>try</code>
block and perform cleanup in a <code>finally</code> clause, as shown in the previous example, because this ensures the
cleanup code is performed even if <code>super.afterAll</code> throws an exception.</p><p>One difference to bear in mind between the before-and-after traits and the <code>withFixture</code> methods, is that if
a <code>withFixture</code> method completes abruptly with an exception, it is considered a failed test. By contrast, if any of the
methods on the before-and-after traits (<em>i.e.</em>, <code>before</code>  and <code>after</code> of <code>BeforeAndAfter</code>,
<code>beforeEach</code> and <code>afterEach</code> of <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code>,
and <code>beforeAll</code> and <code>afterAll</code> of <code>BeforeAndAfterAll</code>) complete abruptly, it is considered a
failed suite, which will result in a <a href="events/SuiteAborted.html"><code>SuiteAborted</code></a> event.</p><p><a name="SharedScenarios"> </a></p><h4> Shared scenarios </h4><p>Sometimes you may want to run the same test code on different fixture objects. In other words, you may want to write tests that are &quot;shared&quot;
by different fixture objects.
To accomplish this in a <code>FeatureSpec</code>, you first place shared tests (<em>i.e.</em>, shared scenarios) in
<em>behavior functions</em>. These behavior functions will be
invoked during the construction phase of any <code>FeatureSpec</code> that uses them, so that the scenarios they contain will
be registered as scenarios in that <code>FeatureSpec</code>.
For example, given this stack class:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">

</pre></p><p>You may want to test the <code>Stack</code> class in different states: empty, full, with one item, with one item less than capacity,
<em>etc</em>. You may find you have several scenarios that make sense any time the stack is non-empty. Thus you'd ideally want to run
those same scenarios for three stack fixture objects: a full stack, a stack with a one item, and a stack with one item less than
capacity. With shared tests, you can factor these scenarios out into a behavior function, into which you pass the
stack fixture to use when running the tests. So in your <code>FeatureSpec</code> for stack, you'd invoke the
behavior function three times, passing in each of the three stack fixtures so that the shared scenarios are run for all three fixtures.</p><p>You can define a behavior function that encapsulates these shared scenarios inside the <code>FeatureSpec</code> that uses them. If they are shared
between different <code>FeatureSpec</code>s, however, you could also define them in a separate trait that is mixed into
each <code>FeatureSpec</code> that uses them.
<a name="StackBehaviors">For</a> example, here the <code>nonEmptyStack</code> behavior function (in this case, a
behavior <em>method</em>) is defined in a trait along with another
method containing shared scenarios for non-full stacks:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">

If you register the same tests repeatedly in the same suite, one problem you may encounter is an exception at runtime
complaining that multiple tests are being registered with the same test name.
In a <code>FeatureSpec</code> there is no nesting construct analogous to <code>Spec</code>'s <code>describe</code> clause.
Therefore, you need to do a bit of
extra work to ensure that the test names are unique. If a duplicate test name problem shows up in a
<code>FeatureSpec</code>, you'll need to pass in a prefix or suffix string to add to each test name. You can pass this string
the same way you pass any other data needed by the shared tests, or just call <code>toString</code> on the shared fixture object.
This is the approach taken by the previous <code>FeatureSpecStackBehaviors</code> example.</p><p>Given this <code>FeatureSpecStackBehaviors</code> trait, calling it with the <code>stackWithOneItem</code> fixture, like this:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">

on this mechanism, see the <a href="Suite.Equalizer.html">documentation for </code>Equalizer</code></a>.</p><p>Because trait <code>Suite</code> mixes in <code>Assertions</code>, this implicit conversion will always be
available by default in ScalaTest <code>Suite</code>s. This is the only implicit conversion that is in scope by default in every
ScalaTest <code>Suite</code>. Other implicit conversions offered by ScalaTest, such as those that support the matchers DSL
or <code>invokePrivate</code>, must be explicitly invited into your test code, either by mixing in a trait or importing the
members of its companion object. The reason ScalaTest requires you to invite in implicit conversions (with the exception of the
implicit conversion for <code>===</code> operator)  is because if one of ScalaTest's implicit conversions clashes with an
implicit conversion used in the code you are trying to test, your program won't compile. Thus there is a chance that if you
are ever trying to use a library or test some code that also offers an implicit conversion involving a <code>===</code> operator,
you could run into the problem of a compiler error due to an ambiguous implicit conversion. If that happens, you can turn off
the implicit conversion offered by this <code>convertToEqualizer</code> method simply by overriding the method in your
<code>Suite</code> subclass, but not marking it as implicit:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">

method, all of which have default values. This behavior is convenient when working with ScalaTest in the Scala interpreter.
Here's a summary of this method's parameters and how you can use them:</p><p><strong>The <code>testName</code> parameter</strong></p><p>If you leave <code>testName</code> at its default value (of <code>null</code>), this method will pass <code>None</code> to
the <code>testName</code> parameter of <code>run</code>, and as a result all the tests in this suite will be executed. If you
specify a <code>testName</code>, this method will pass <code>Some(testName)</code> to <code>run</code>, and only that test
will be run. Thus to run all tests in a suite from the Scala interpreter, you can write:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).execute()
</pre></p><p>To run just the test named <code>"my favorite test"</code> in a suite from the Scala interpreter, you would write:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).execute(&quot;my favorite test&quot;)
</pre></p><p>Or:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).execute(testName = &quot;my favorite test&quot;)
</pre></p><p><strong>The <code>configMap</code> parameter</strong></p><p>If you provide a value for the <code>configMap</code> parameter, this method will pass it to <code>run</code>. If not, the default value
of an empty <code>Map</code> will be passed. For more information on how to use a config map to configure your test suites, see
the <a href="#configMapSection">config map section</a> in the main documentation for this trait. Here's an example in which you configure
a run with the name of an input file:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).execute(configMap = Map(&quot;inputFileName&quot; -&gt; &quot;in.txt&quot;)
</pre></p><p><strong>The <code>color</code> parameter</strong></p><p>If you leave the <code>color</code> parameter unspecified, this method will configure the reporter it passes to <code>run</code> to print
to the standard output in color (via ansi escape characters). If you don't want color output, specify false for <code>color</code>, like this:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).execute(color = false)
</pre></p><p><strong>The <code>durations</code> parameter</strong></p><p>If you leave the <code>durations</code> parameter unspecified, this method will configure the reporter it passes to <code>run</code> to
<em>not</em> print durations for tests and suites to the standard output. If you want durations printed, specify true for <code>durations</code>,
like this:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">

</pre></p><p><strong>The <code>shortstacks</code> and <code>fullstacks</code> parameters</strong></p><p>If you leave both the <code>shortstacks</code> and <code>fullstacks</code> parameters unspecified, this method will configure the reporter
it passes to <code>run</code> to <em>not</em> print stack traces for failed tests if it has a stack depth that identifies the offending
line of test code. If you prefer a short stack trace (10 to 15 stack frames) to be printed with any test failure, specify true for
<code>shortstacks</code>:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).execute(shortstacks = true)
</pre></p><p>For full stack traces, set <code>fullstacks</code> to true:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).execute(fullstacks = true)
</pre></p><p>If you specify true for both <code>shortstacks</code> and <code>fullstacks</code>, you'll get full stack traces.</p><p><strong>The <code>stats</code> parameter</strong></p><p>If you leave the <code>stats</code> parameter unspecified, this method will <em>not</em> fire <code>RunStarting</code> and either <code>RunCompleted</code>
or <code>RunAborted</code> events to the reporter it passes to <code>run</code>.
If you specify true for <code>stats</code>, this method will fire the run events to the reporter, and the reporter will print the
expected test count before the run, and various statistics after, including the number of suites completed and number of tests that
succeeded, failed, were ignored or marked pending. Here's how you get the stats:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).execute(stats = true)
</pre></p><p>To summarize, this method will pass to <code>run</code>:</p><ul><li><code>testName</code> - <code>None</code> if this method's <code>testName</code> parameter is left at its default value of <code>null</code>, else <code>Some(testName)</code>.</li><li><code>reporter</code> - a reporter that prints to the standard output</li><li><code>stopper</code> - a <code>Stopper</code> whose <code>apply</code> method always returns <code>false</code></li><li><code>filter</code> - a <code>Filter</code> constructed with <code>None</code> for <code>tagsToInclude</code> and <code>Set()</code>
  for <code>tagsToExclude</code></li><li><code>configMap</code> - the <code>configMap</code> passed to this method</li><li><code>distributor</code> - <code>None</code></li><li><code>tracker</code> - a new <code>Tracker</code></li></ul><p>Note:  In ScalaTest, the terms &quot;execute&quot; and &quot;run&quot; basically mean the same thing and
can be used interchangably. The reason this method isn't named <code>run</code> is that it takes advantage of
default arguments, and you can't mix overloaded methods and default arguments in Scala. (If named <code>run</code>,
this method would have the same name but different arguments than the main <a href="#run"><code>run</code> method</a> that
takes seven arguments. Thus it would overload and couldn't be used with default argument values.)</p><p>Design note: This method has two &quot;features&quot; that may seem unidiomatic. First, the default value of <code>testName</code> is <code>null</code>.
Normally in Scala the type of <code>testName</code> would be <code>Option[String]</code> and the default value would
be <code>None</code>, as it is in this trait's <code>run</code> method. The <code>null</code> value is used here for two reasons. First, in
ScalaTest 1.5, <code>execute</code> was changed from four overloaded methods to one method with default values, taking advantage of
the default and named parameters feature introduced in Scala 2.8.
To not break existing source code, <code>testName</code> needed to have type <code>String</code>, as it did in two of the overloaded
<code>execute</code> methods prior to 1.5. The other reason is that <code>execute</code> has always been designed to be called primarily
from an interpeter environment, such as the Scala REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop). In an interpreter environment, minimizing keystrokes is king.
A <code>String</code> type with a <code>null</code> default value lets users type <code>suite.execute("my test name")</code> rather than
<code>suite.execute(Some("my test name"))</code>, saving several keystrokes.</p><p>The second non-idiomatic feature is that <code>shortstacks</code> and <code>fullstacks</code> are all lower case rather than
camel case. This is done to be consistent with the <a href="Shell.html"><code>Shell</code></a>, which also uses those forms. The reason
lower case is used in the <code>Shell</code> is to save keystrokes in an interpreter environment.  Most Unix commands, for
example, are all lower case, making them easier and quicker to type.  In the ScalaTest
<code>Shell</code>, methods like <code>shortstacks</code>, <code>fullstacks</code>, and <code>nostats</code>, <em>etc.</em>, are
designed to be all lower case so they feel more like shell commands than methods.</p></div><dl class="paramcmts block"><dt class="param">testName</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>the name of one test to run.</p></dd><dt class="param">configMap</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>a <code>Map</code> of key-value pairs that can be used by the executing <code>Suite</code> of tests.</p></dd><dt class="param">color</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>a boolean that configures whether output is printed in color</p></dd><dt class="param">durations</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>a boolean that configures whether test and suite durations are printed to the standard output</p></dd><dt class="param">shortstacks</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>a boolean that configures whether short stack traces should be printed for test failures</p></dd><dt class="param">fullstacks</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>a boolean that configures whether full stack traces should be printed for test failures</p></dd><dt class="param">stats</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>a boolean that configures whether test and suite statistics are printed to the standard output

The purpose of
pending tests is to facilitate a style of testing in which documentation of behavior is sketched
out before tests are written to verify that behavior (and often, the before the behavior of
the system being tested is itself implemented). Such sketches form a kind of specification of
what tests and functionality to implement later.</p><p>To support this style of testing, a test can be given a name that specifies one
bit of behavior required by the system being tested. The test can also include some code that
sends more information about the behavior to the reporter when the tests run. At the end of the test,
it can call method <code>pending</code>, which will cause it to complete abruptly with <code>TestPendingException</code>.
Because tests in ScalaTest can be designated as pending with <code>TestPendingException</code>, both the test name and any information
sent to the reporter when running the test can appear in the report of a test run. (In other words,
the code of a pending test is executed just like any other test.) However, because the test completes abruptly
with <code>TestPendingException</code>, the test will be reported as pending, to indicate
the actual test, and possibly the functionality it is intended to test, has not yet been implemented.</p><p>Note: This method always completes abruptly with a <code>TestPendingException</code>. Thus it always has a side
effect. Methods with side effects are usually invoked with parentheses, as in <code>pending()</code>. This
method is defined as a parameterless method, in flagrant contradiction to recommended Scala style, because it
forms a kind of DSL for pending tests. It enables tests in suites such as <code>FunSuite</code> or <code>Spec</code>
to be denoted by placing &quot;<code>(pending)</code>&quot; after the test name, as in:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
test(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;that style rules are not laws&quot;</span>) (pending)
</pre></p><p>Readers of the code see &quot;pending&quot; in parentheses, which looks like a little note attached to the test name to indicate
it is pending. Whereas &quot;<code>(pending())</code> looks more like a method call, &quot;<code>(pending)</code>&quot; lets readers
stay at a higher level, forgetting how it is implemented and just focusing on the intent of the programmer who wrote the code.</p></div><dl class="attributes block"> <dt>Definition Classes</dt><dd><a name="org.scalatest.Suite" class="extype" href="Suite.html">Suite</a></dd></dl></div>

automatically turn back into a failing test once the problem originally causing the test to fail has been fixed.
At that point, you need only remove the <code>pendingUntilFixed</code> call. In other words, a
<code>pendingUntilFixed</code> surrounding a block of code that isn't broken is treated as a test failure.
The motivation for this behavior is to encourage people to remove <code>pendingUntilFixed</code> calls when
there are no longer needed.</p><p>This method facilitates a style of testing in which tests are written before the code they test. Sometimes you may
encounter a test failure that requires more functionality than you want to tackle without writing more tests. In this
case you can mark the bit of test code causing the failure with <code>pendingUntilFixed</code>. You can then write more
tests and functionality that eventually will get your production code to a point where the original test won't fail anymore.
At this point the code block marked with <code>pendingUntilFixed</code> will no longer throw an exception (because the
problem has been fixed). This will in turn cause <code>pendingUntilFixed</code> to throw <code>TestFailedException</code>
with a detail message explaining you need to go back and remove the <code>pendingUntilFixed</code> call as the problem orginally
causing your test code to fail has been fixed.</p></div><dl class="paramcmts block"><dt class="param">f</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>a block of code, which if it completes abruptly, should trigger a <code>TestPendingException</code></p></dd></dl><dl class="attributes block"> <dt>Definition Classes</dt><dd><a name="org.scalatest.Suite" class="extype" href="Suite.html">Suite</a></dd></dl></div>

<code>OneInstancePerTest</code> trait depends on this behavior, for example.)</p><p>Subclasses and subtraits that override this <code>run</code> method can implement them without
invoking either the <code>runTests</code> or <code>runNestedSuites</code> methods, which
are invoked by this trait's implementation of this method. It is recommended, but not required,
that subclasses and subtraits that override <code>run</code> in a way that does not

that subclasses and subtraits that override <code>run</code> in a way that does not

of the method, or throw an <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code> if appropriate. The
reason for this recommendation is that ScalaTest includes several traits that override
these methods to allow behavior to be mixed into a <code>Suite</code>. For example, trait
<code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> overrides <code>runTests</code>s. In a <code>Suite</code>
subclass that no longer invokes <code>runTests</code> from <code>run</code>, the
<code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> trait is not applicable. Mixing it in would have no effect.
By making <code>runTests</code> final in such a <code>Suite</code> subtrait, you make
the attempt to mix <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> into a subclass of your subtrait
a compiler error. (It would fail to compile with a complaint that <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code>
