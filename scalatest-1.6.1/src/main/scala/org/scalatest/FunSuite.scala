/**
 * A suite of tests in which each test is represented as a function value. The &#8220;<code>Fun</code>&#8221; in <code>FunSuite</code> stands
 * for &#8220;function.&#8221; Here's an example <code>FunSuite</code>:
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FunSuite
 *
 * class ExampleSuite extends FunSuite {
 *
 *   test("addition") {
 *     val sum = 1 + 1
 *     assert(sum === 2)
 *   }
 *
 *   test("subtraction") {
 *     val diff = 4 - 1
 *     assert(diff === 3)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * &#8220;<code>test</code>&#8221; is a method, defined in <code>FunSuite</code>, which will be invoked
 * by the primary constructor of <code>ExampleSuite</code>. You specify the name of the test as
 * a string between the parentheses, and the test code itself between curly braces.
 * The test code is a function passed as a by-name parameter to <code>test</code>, which registers
 * it for later execution. One benefit of <code>FunSuite</code> compared to <code>Suite</code> is you need not name all your
 * tests starting with &#8220;<code>test</code>.&#8221; In addition, you can more easily give long names to
 * your tests, because you need not encode them in camel case.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A <code>FunSuite</code>'s lifecycle has two phases: the <em>registration</em> phase and the
 * <em>ready</em> phase. It starts in registration phase and enters ready phase the first time
 * <code>run</code> is called on it. It then remains in ready phase for the remainder of its lifetime.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Tests can only be registered with the <code>test</code> method while the <code>FunSuite</code> is
 * in its registration phase. Any attempt to register a test after the <code>FunSuite</code> has
 * entered its ready phase, <em>i.e.</em>, after <code>run</code> has been invoked on the <code>FunSuite</code>,
 * will be met with a thrown <code>TestRegistrationClosedException</code>. The recommended style
 * of using <code>FunSuite</code> is to register tests during object construction as is done in all
 * the examples shown here. If you keep to the recommended style, you should never see a
 * <code>TestRegistrationClosedException</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * See also: <a href="http://www.scalatest.org/getting_started_with_fun_suite" target="_blank">Getting started with <code>FunSuite</code>.</a>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h2>Ignored tests</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * To support the common use case of &#8220;temporarily&#8221; disabling a test, with the
 * good intention of resurrecting the test at a later time, <code>FunSuite</code> provides registration
 * methods that start with <code>ignore</code> instead of <code>test</code>. For example, to temporarily
 * disable the test named <code>addition</code>, just change &#8220;<code>test</code>&#8221; into &#8220;<code>ignore</code>,&#8221; like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FunSuite
 *
 * class ExampleSuite extends FunSuite {
 *
 *   ignore("addition") {
 *     val sum = 1 + 1
 *     assert(sum === 2)
 *   }
 *
 *   test("subtraction") {
 *     val diff = 4 - 1
 *     assert(diff === 3)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you run this version of <code>ExampleSuite</code> with:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * scala> (new ExampleSuite).execute()
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * It will run only <code>subtraction</code> and report that <code>addition</code> was ignored:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * <span class="stGreen">ExampleSuite:</span>
 * <span class="stYellow">- addition !!! IGNORED !!!</span>
 * <span class="stGreen">- subtraction</span>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Informers</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * One of the parameters to the <code>run</code> method is a <code>Reporter</code>, which
 * will collect and report information about the running suite of tests.
 * Information about suites and tests that were run, whether tests succeeded or failed, 
 * and tests that were ignored will be passed to the <code>Reporter</code> as the suite runs.
 * Most often the reporting done by default by <code>FunSuite</code>'s methods will be sufficient, but
 * occasionally you may wish to provide custom information to the <code>Reporter</code> from a test.
 * For this purpose, an <code>Informer</code> that will forward information to the current <code>Reporter</code>
 * is provided via the <code>info</code> parameterless method.
 * You can pass the extra information to the <code>Informer</code> via one of its <code>apply</code> methods.
 * The <code>Informer</code> will then pass the information to the <code>Reporter</code> via an <code>InfoProvided</code> event.
 * Here's an example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FunSuite
 *
 * class ExampleSuite extends FunSuite {
 *
 *   test("addition") {
 *     val sum = 1 + 1
 *     assert(sum === 2)
 *     assert(sum + 2 === 4)
 *     info("Addition seems to work")
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * If you run this <code>FunSuite</code> from the interpreter, you will see the following message
 * included in the printed report:
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * <span class="stGreen">ExampleSuite:
 * - addition
 *   + Addition seems to work</span> 
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Pending tests</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * A <em>pending test</em> is one that has been given a name but is not yet implemented. The purpose of
 * pending tests is to facilitate a style of testing in which documentation of behavior is sketched
 * out before tests are written to verify that behavior (and often, before the behavior of
 * the system being tested is itself implemented). Such sketches form a kind of specification of
 * what tests and functionality to implement later.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To support this style of testing, a test can be given a name that specifies one
 * bit of behavior required by the system being tested. The test can also include some code that
 * sends more information about the behavior to the reporter when the tests run. At the end of the test,
 * it can call method <code>pending</code>, which will cause it to complete abruptly with <code>TestPendingException</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Because tests in ScalaTest can be designated as pending with <code>TestPendingException</code>, both the test name and any information
 * sent to the reporter when running the test can appear in the report of a test run. (In other words,
 * the code of a pending test is executed just like any other test.) However, because the test completes abruptly
 * with <code>TestPendingException</code>, the test will be reported as pending, to indicate
 * the actual test, and possibly the functionality, has not yet been implemented.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Although pending tests may be used more often in specification-style suites, such as
 * <code>org.scalatest.Spec</code>, you can also use it in <code>FunSuite</code>, like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FunSuite
 *
 * class ExampleSuite extends FunSuite {
 *
 *   test("addition") {
 *     val sum = 1 + 1
 *     assert(sum === 2)
 *     assert(sum + 2 === 4)
 *   }
 *
 *   test("subtraction") (pending)
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * (Note: "<code>(pending)</code>" is the body of the test. Thus the test contains just one statement, an invocation
 * of the <code>pending</code> method, which throws <code>TestPendingException</code>.)
 * If you run this version of <code>ExampleSuite</code> with:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * scala> (new ExampleSuite).execute()
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * It will run both tests, but report that <code>subtraction</code> is pending. You'll see:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * <span class="stGreen">ExampleSuite:
 * - addition</span>
 * <span class="stYellow">- subtraction (pending)</span>
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h2>Tagging tests</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * A <code>FunSuite</code>'s tests may be classified into groups by <em>tagging</em> them with string names.
 * As with any suite, when executing a <code>FunSuite</code>, groups of tests can
 * optionally be included and/or excluded. To tag a <code>FunSuite</code>'s tests,
 * you pass objects that extend abstract class <code>org.scalatest.Tag</code> to methods
 * that register tests, <code>test</code> and <code>ignore</code>. Class <code>Tag</code> takes one parameter, a string name.  If you have
 * created Java annotation interfaces for use as group names in direct subclasses of <code>org.scalatest.Suite</code>,
 * then you will probably want to use group names on your <code>FunSuite</code>s that match. To do so, simply 
 * pass the fully qualified names of the Java interfaces to the <code>Tag</code> constructor. For example, if you've
 * defined Java annotation interfaces with fully qualified names, <code>com.mycompany.tags.SlowTest</code> and
 * <code>com.mycompany.tags.DbTest</code>, then you could
 * create matching groups for <code>FunSuite</code>s like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.Tag
 *
 * object SlowTest extends Tag("com.mycompany.tags.SlowTest")
 * object DbTest extends Tag("com.mycompany.tags.DbTest")
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Given these definitions, you could place <code>FunSuite</code> tests into groups like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FunSuite
 *
 * class ExampleSuite extends FunSuite {
 *
 *   test("addition", SlowTest) {
 *     val sum = 1 + 1
 *     assert(sum === 2)
 *   }
 *
 *   test("subtraction", SlowTest, DbTest) {
 *     val diff = 4 - 1
 *     assert(diff === 3)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * This code marks both tests, "addition" and "subtraction," with the <code>com.mycompany.tags.SlowTest</code> tag, 
 * and test "subtraction" with the <code>com.mycompany.tags.DbTest</code> tag.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The <code>run</code> method takes a <code>Filter</code>, whose constructor takes an optional
 * <code>Set[String]</code> called <code>tagsToInclude</code> and a <code>Set[String]</code> called
 * <code>tagsToExclude</code>. If <code>tagsToInclude</code> is <code>None</code>, all tests will be run
 * except those those belonging to tags listed in the
 * <code>tagsToExclude</code> <code>Set</code>. If <code>tagsToInclude</code> is defined, only tests
 * belonging to tags mentioned in the <code>tagsToInclude</code> set, and not mentioned in <code>tagsToExclude</code>,
 * will be run.
 * </p>
 *
 * <a name="sharedFixtures"></a><h2>Shared fixtures</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * A test <em>fixture</em> is objects or other artifacts (such as files, sockets, database
 * connections, <em>etc.</em>) used by tests to do their work.
 * If a fixture is used by only one test method, then the definitions of the fixture objects can
 * be local to the method, such as the objects assigned to <code>sum</code> and <code>diff</code> in the
 * previous <code>ExampleSuite</code> examples. If multiple methods need to share an immutable fixture, one approach
 * is to assign them to instance variables.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In some cases, however, shared <em>mutable</em> fixture objects may be changed by test methods such that
 * they need to be recreated or reinitialized before each test. Shared resources such
 * as files or database connections may also need to 
 * be created and initialized before, and cleaned up after, each test. JUnit 3 offered methods <code>setUp</code> and
 * <code>tearDown</code> for this purpose. In ScalaTest, you can use the <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> trait,
 * which will be described later, to implement an approach similar to JUnit's <code>setUp</code>
 * and <code>tearDown</code>, however, this approach usually involves reassigning <code>var</code>s or mutating objects
 * between tests. Before going that route, you may wish to consider some more functional approaches that
 * avoid side effects.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h4>Calling create-fixture methods</h4>
 *
 * <p>
 * One approach is to write one or more <em>create-fixture</em> methods
 * that return a new instance of a needed fixture object (or an holder object containing multiple needed fixture objects) each time it
 * is called. You can then call a create-fixture method at the beginning of each
 * test method that needs the fixture, storing the returned object or objects in local variables. Here's an example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FunSuite
 * import collection.mutable.ListBuffer
 *
 * class ExampleSuite extends FunSuite {
 * 
 *   def fixture =
 *     new {
 *       val builder = new StringBuilder("ScalaTest is ")
 *       val buffer = new ListBuffer[String]
 *     }
 * 
 *   test("easy") {
 *     val f = fixture
 *     f.builder.append("easy!")
 *     assert(f.builder.toString === "ScalaTest is easy!")
 *     assert(f.buffer.isEmpty)
 *     f.buffer += "sweet"
 *   }
 * 
 *   test("fun") {
 *     val f = fixture
 *     f.builder.append("fun!")
 *     assert(f.builder.toString === "ScalaTest is fun!")
 *     assert(f.buffer.isEmpty)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The &ldquo;<code>f.</code>&rdquo; in front of each use of a fixture object provides a visual indication of which objects 
 * are part of the fixture, but if you prefer, you can import the the members with &ldquo;<code>import f._</code>&rdquo; and use the names directly.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h4>Instantiating fixture traits</h4>
 *
 * <p>
 * A related technique is to place
 * the fixture objects in a <em>fixture trait</em> and run your test code in the context of a new anonymous class instance that mixes in
 * the fixture trait, like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FunSuite
 * import collection.mutable.ListBuffer
 * 
 * class ExampleSuite extends FunSuite {
 * 
 *   trait Fixture {
 *     val builder = new StringBuilder("ScalaTest is ")
 *     val buffer = new ListBuffer[String]
 *   }
 * 
 *   test("easy") {
 *     new Fixture {
 *       builder.append("easy!")
 *       assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is easy!")
 *       assert(buffer.isEmpty)
 *       buffer += "sweet"
 *     }
 *   }
 * 
 *   test("fun") {
 *     new Fixture {
 *       builder.append("fun!")
 *       assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is fun!")
 *       assert(buffer.isEmpty)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h4>Mixing in <code>OneInstancePerTest</code></h4>
 *
 * <p>
 * If every test method requires the same set of
 * mutable fixture objects, one other approach you can take is make them simply <code>val</code>s and mix in trait
 * <a href="OneInstancePerTest.html"><code>OneInstancePerTest</code></a>.  If you mix in <code>OneInstancePerTest</code>, each test
 * will be run in its own instance of the <code>Suite</code>, similar to the way JUnit tests are executed. Here's an example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FunSuite
 * import org.scalatest.OneInstancePerTest
 * import collection.mutable.ListBuffer
 * 
 * class ExampleSuite extends FunSuite with OneInstancePerTest {
 * 
 *   val builder = new StringBuilder("ScalaTest is ")
 *   val buffer = new ListBuffer[String]
 * 
 *   test("easy") {
 *     builder.append("easy!")
 *     assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is easy!")
 *     assert(buffer.isEmpty)
 *     buffer += "sweet"
 *   }
 * 
 *   test("fun") {
 *     builder.append("fun!")
 *     assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is fun!")
 *     assert(buffer.isEmpty)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Although the create-fixture, fixture-trait, and <code>OneInstancePerTest</code> approaches take care of setting up a fixture before each
 * test, they don't address the problem of cleaning up a fixture after the test completes. In this situation, you'll need to either
 * use side effects or the <em>loan pattern</em>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h4>Mixing in <code>BeforeAndAfter</code></h4>
 *
 * <p>
 * One way to use side effects is to mix in the <a href="BeforeAndAfter.html"><code>BeforeAndAfter</code></a> trait.
 * With this trait you can denote a bit of code to run before each test with <code>before</code> and/or after each test
 * each test with <code>after</code>, like this:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FunSuite
 * import org.scalatest.BeforeAndAfter
 * import collection.mutable.ListBuffer
 * 
 * class ExampleSuite extends FunSuite with BeforeAndAfter {
 * 
 *   val builder = new StringBuilder
 *   val buffer = new ListBuffer[String]
 * 
 *   before {
 *     builder.append("ScalaTest is ")
 *   }
 * 
 *   after {
 *     builder.clear()
 *     buffer.clear()
 *   }
 * 
 *   test("easy") {
 *     builder.append("easy!")
 *     assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is easy!")
 *     assert(buffer.isEmpty)
 *     buffer += "sweet"
 *   }
 * 
 *   test("fun") {
 *     builder.append("fun!")
 *     assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is fun!")
 *     assert(buffer.isEmpty)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h4>Overriding <code>withFixture(NoArgTest)</code></h4>
 *
 * <p>
 * An alternate way to take care of setup and cleanup via side effects
 * is to override <code>withFixture</code>. Trait <code>Suite</code>'s implementation of
 * <code>runTest</code>, which is inherited by this trait, passes a no-arg test function to <code>withFixture</code>. It is <code>withFixture</code>'s
 * responsibility to invoke that test function.  <code>Suite</code>'s implementation of <code>withFixture</code> simply
 * invokes the function, like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * // Default implementation
 * protected def withFixture(test: NoArgTest) {
 *   test()
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * You can, therefore, override <code>withFixture</code> to perform setup before, and cleanup after, invoking the test function. If
 * you have cleanup to perform, you should invoke the test function
 * inside a <code>try</code> block and perform the cleanup in a <code>finally</code> clause.
 * Here's an example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FunSuite
 * import collection.mutable.ListBuffer
 *
 * class ExampleSuite extends FunSuite {
 *
 *   val builder = new StringBuilder
 *   val buffer = new ListBuffer[String]
 *
 *   override def withFixture(test: NoArgTest) {
 *     builder.append("ScalaTest is ") // perform setup
 *     try {
 *       test() // invoke the test function
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       builder.clear() // perform cleanup
 *       buffer.clear()
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   test("easy") {
 *     builder.append("easy!")
 *     assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is easy!")
 *     assert(buffer.isEmpty)
 *     buffer += "sweet"
 *   }
 *
 *   test("fun") {
 *     builder.append("fun!")
 *     assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is fun!")
 *     assert(buffer.isEmpty)
 *     buffer += "clear"
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that the <a href="Suite$NoArgTest.html"><code>NoArgTest</code></a> passed to <code>withFixture</code>, in addition to
 * an <code>apply</code> method that executes the test, also includes the test name as well as the <a href="Suite.html#configMapSection">config
 * map</a> passed to <code>runTest</code>. Thus you can also use the test name and configuration objects in <code>withFixture</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The reason you should perform cleanup in a <code>finally</code> clause is that <code>withFixture</code> is called by
 * <code>runTest</code>, which expects an exception to be thrown to indicate a failed test. Thus when you invoke
 * the <code>test</code> function inside <code>withFixture</code>, it may complete abruptly with an exception. The <code>finally</code>
 * clause will ensure the fixture cleanup happens as that exception propagates back up the call stack to <code>runTest</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h4>Overriding <code>withFixture(OneArgTest)</code></h4>
 *
 * <p>
 * To use the loan pattern, you can extend <code>FixtureFunSuite</code> (from the <code>org.scalatest.fixture</code> package) instead of
 * <code>FunSuite</code>. Each test in a <code>FixtureFunSuite</code> takes a fixture as a parameter, allowing you to pass the fixture into
 * the test. You must indicate the type of the fixture parameter by specifying <code>FixtureParam</code>, and implement a
 * <code>withFixture</code> method that takes a <code>OneArgTest</code>. This <code>withFixture</code> method is responsible for
 * invoking the one-arg test function, so you can perform fixture set up before, and clean up after, invoking and passing
 * the fixture into the test function. Here's an example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.fixture.FixtureFunSuite
 * import java.io.FileWriter
 * import java.io.File
 * 
 * class ExampleSuite extends FixtureFunSuite {
 * 
 *   final val tmpFile = "temp.txt"
 * 
 *   type FixtureParam = FileWriter
 * 
 *   def withFixture(test: OneArgTest) {
 * 
 *     val writer = new FileWriter(tmpFile) // set up the fixture
 *     try {
 *       test(writer) // "loan" the fixture to the test
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       writer.close() // clean up the fixture
 *     }
 *   }
 * 
 *   test("easy") { writer =>
 *     writer.write("Hello, test!")
 *     writer.flush()
 *     assert(new File(tmpFile).length === 12)
 *   }
 * 
 *   test("fun") { writer =>
 *     writer.write("Hi, test!")
 *     writer.flush()
 *     assert(new File(tmpFile).length === 9)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>

 *
 * <a name="differentFixtures"></a><h2>Providing different fixtures to different tests</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If different tests in the same <code>FunSuite</code> require different fixtures, you can combine the previous techniques and
 * provide each test with just the fixture or fixtures it needs. Here's an example in which a <code>StringBuilder</code> and a
 * <code>ListBuffer</code> are provided via fixture traits, and file writer (that requires cleanup) is provided via the loan pattern:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import java.io.FileWriter
 * import java.io.File
 * import collection.mutable.ListBuffer
 * import org.scalatest.FunSuite
 * 
 * class ExampleSuite extends FunSuite {
 * 
 *   final val tmpFile = "temp.txt"
 * 
 *   trait Builder {
 *     val builder = new StringBuilder("ScalaTest is ")
 *   }
 * 
 *   trait Buffer {
 *     val buffer = ListBuffer("ScalaTest", "is")
 *   }
 * 
 *   def withWriter(testCode: FileWriter => Any) {
 *     val writer = new FileWriter(tmpFile) // set up the fixture
 *     try {
 *       testCode(writer) // "loan" the fixture to the test
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       writer.close() // clean up the fixture
 *     }
 *   }
 * 
 *   test("productive") { // This test needs the StringBuilder fixture
 *     new Builder {
 *       builder.append("productive!")
 *       assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is productive!")
 *     }
 *   }
 * 
 *   test("readable") { // This test needs the ListBuffer[String] fixture
 *     new Buffer {
 *       buffer += ("readable!")
 *       assert(buffer === List("ScalaTest", "is", "readable!"))
 *     }
 *   }
 * 
 *   test("friendly") { // This test needs the FileWriter fixture
 *     withWriter { writer =>
 *       writer.write("Hello, user!")
 *       writer.flush()
 *       assert(new File(tmpFile).length === 12)
 *     }
 *   }
 * 
 *   test("clear and concise") { // This test needs the StringBuilder and ListBuffer
 *     new Builder with Buffer {
 *       builder.append("clear!")
 *       buffer += ("concise!")
 *       assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is clear!")
 *       assert(buffer === List("ScalaTest", "is", "concise!"))
 *     }
 *   }
 * 
 *   test("composable") { // This test needs all three fixtures
 *     new Builder with Buffer {
 *       builder.append("clear!")
 *       buffer += ("concise!")
 *       assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is clear!")
 *       assert(buffer === List("ScalaTest", "is", "concise!"))
 *       withWriter { writer =>
 *         writer.write(builder.toString)
 *         writer.flush()
 *         assert(new File(tmpFile).length === 19)
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * In the previous example, <code>productive</code> uses only the <code>StringBuilder</code> fixture, so it just instantiates
 * a <code>new Builder</code>, whereas <code>readable</code> uses only the <code>ListBuffer</code> fixture, so it just intantiates
 * a <code>new Buffer</code>. <code>friendly</code> needs just the <code>FileWriter</code> fixture, so it invokes
 * <code>withWriter</code>, which prepares and passes a <code>FileWriter</code> to the test (and takes care of closing it afterwords).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Two tests need multiple fixtures: <code>clear and concise</code> needs both the <code>StringBuilder</code> and the
 * <code>ListBuffer</code>, so it instantiates a class that mixes in both fixture traits with <code>new Builder with Buffer</code>.
 * <code>composable</code> needs all three fixtures, so in addition to <code>new Builder with Buffer</code> it also invokes
 * <code>withWriter</code>, wrapping just the of the test code that needs the fixture.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that in this case, the loan pattern is being implemented via the <code>withWriter</code> method that takes a function, not
 * by overriding <code>FixtureFunSuite</code>'s <code>withFixture(OneArgTest)</code> method. <code>FixtureFunSuite</code> makes the most sense
 * if all (or at least most) tests need the same fixture, whereas in this <code>Suite</code> only two tests need the
 * <code>FileWriter</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In the previous example, the <code>withWriter</code> method passed an object into
 * the tests. Passing fixture objects into tests is generally a good idea when possible, but sometimes a side affect is unavoidable.
 * For example, if you need to initialize a database running on a server across a network, your with-fixture 
 * method will likely have nothing to pass. In such cases, simply create a with-fixture method that takes a by-name parameter and
 * performs setup and cleanup via side effects, like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * def withDataInDatabase(test: => Any) {
 *   // initialize the database across the network
 *   try {
 *     test // "loan" the initialized database to the test
 *   }
 *   finally {
 *     // clean up the database
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * You can then use it like:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * def testUserLogsIn {
 *   withDataInDatabase {
 *     // test user logging in scenario
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <a name="composingFixtures"></a><h2>Composing stackable fixture traits</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * In larger projects, teams often end up with several different fixtures that test classes need in different combinations,
 * and possibly initialized (and cleaned up) in different orders. A good way to accomplish this in ScalaTest is to factor the individual
 * fixtures into traits that can be composed using the <em>stackable trait</em> pattern. This can be done, for example, by placing
 * <code>withFixture</code> methods in several traits, each of which call <code>super.withFixture</code>. Here's an example in
 * which the <code>StringBuilder</code> and <code>ListBuffer[String]</code> fixtures used in the previous examples have been
 * factored out into two <em>stackable fixture traits</em> named <code>Builder</code> and <code>Buffer</code>:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FunSuite
 * import org.scalatest.AbstractSuite
 * import collection.mutable.ListBuffer
 * 
 * trait Builder extends AbstractSuite { this: Suite =>
 *
 *   val builder = new StringBuilder
 *
 *   abstract override def withFixture(test: NoArgTest) {
 *     builder.append("ScalaTest is ")
 *     try {
 *       super.withFixture(test) // To be stackable, must call super.withFixture
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       builder.clear()
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * trait Buffer extends AbstractSuite { this: Suite =>
 *
 *   val buffer = new ListBuffer[String]
 *
 *   abstract override def withFixture(test: NoArgTest) {
 *     try {
 *       super.withFixture(test) // To be stackable, must call super.withFixture
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       buffer.clear()
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * 
 * class ExampleSuite extends FunSuite with Builder with Buffer {
 * 
 *   test("easy") {
 *     builder.append("easy!")
 *     assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is easy!")
 *     assert(buffer.isEmpty)
 *     buffer += "sweet"
 *   }
 * 
 *   test("fun") {
 *     builder.append("fun!")
 *     assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is fun!")
 *     assert(buffer.isEmpty)
 *     buffer += "clear"
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * By mixing in both the <code>Builder</code> and <code>Buffer</code> traits, <code>ExampleSuite</code> gets both fixtures, which will be
 * initialized before each test and cleaned up after. The order the traits are mixed together determines the order of execution.
 * In this case, <code>Builder</code> is "super" to </code>Buffer</code>. If you wanted <code>Buffer</code> to be "super"
 * to <code>Builder</code>, you need only switch the order you mix them together, like this: 
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * class Example2Suite extends FunSuite with Buffer with Builder
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * And if you only need one fixture you mix in only that trait:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * class Example3Suite extends FunSuite with Builder
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Another way to create stackable fixture traits is by extending the <a href="BeforeAndAfterEach.html"><code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code></a>
 * and/or <a href="BeforeAndAfterAll.html"><code>BeforeAndAfterAll</code></a> traits.
 * <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> has a <code>beforeEach</code> method that will be run before each test (like JUnit's <code>setUp</code>),
 * and an <code>afterEach</code> method that will be run after (like JUnit's <code>tearDown</code>).
 * Similarly, <code>BeforeAndAfterAll</code> has a <code>beforeAll</code> method that will be run before all tests,
 * and an <code>afterAll</code> method that will be run after all tests. Here's what the previously shown example would look like if it
 * were rewritten to use the <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> methods instead of <code>withFixture</code>:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FunSuite
 * import org.scalatest.BeforeAndAfterEach
 * import collection.mutable.ListBuffer
 * 
 * trait Builder extends BeforeAndAfterEach { this: Suite =>
 * 
 *   val builder = new StringBuilder
 * 
 *   override def beforeEach() {
 *     builder.append("ScalaTest is ")
 *     super.beforeEach() // To be stackable, must call super.beforeEach
 *   }
 * 
 *   override def afterEach() {
 *     try {
 *       super.afterEach() // To be stackable, must call super.afterEach
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       builder.clear()
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * 
 * trait Buffer extends BeforeAndAfterEach { this: Suite =>
 * 
 *   val buffer = new ListBuffer[String]
 * 
 *   override def afterEach() {
 *     try {
 *       super.afterEach() // To be stackable, must call super.afterEach
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       buffer.clear()
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * 
 * class ExampleSuite extends FunSuite with Builder with Buffer {
 * 
 *   test("easy") {
 *     builder.append("easy!")
 *     assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is easy!")
 *     assert(buffer.isEmpty)
 *     buffer += "sweet"
 *   }
 * 
 *   test("fun") {
 *     builder.append("fun!")
 *     assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is fun!")
 *     assert(buffer.isEmpty)
 *     buffer += "clear"
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * To get the same ordering as <code>withFixture</code>, place your <code>super.beforeEach</code> call at the end of each
 * <code>beforeEach</code> method, and the <code>super.afterEach</code> call at the beginning of each <code>afterEach</code>
 * method, as shown in the previous example. It is a good idea to invoke <code>super.afterEach</code> in a <code>try</code>
 * block and perform cleanup in a <code>finally</code> clause, as shown in the previous example, because this ensures the
 * cleanup code is performed even if <code>super.afterAll</code> throws an exception.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * One difference to bear in mind between the before-and-after traits and the <code>withFixture</code> methods, is that if
 * a <code>withFixture</code> method completes abruptly with an exception, it is considered a failed test. By contrast, if any of the
 * methods on the before-and-after traits (<em>i.e.</em>, <code>before</code>  and <code>after</code> of <code>BeforeAndAfter</code>,
 * <code>beforeEach</code> and <code>afterEach</code> of <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code>,
 * and <code>beforeAll</code> and <code>afterAll</code> of <code>BeforeAndAfterAll</code>) complete abruptly, it is considered a
 * failed suite, which will result in a <a href="events/SuiteAborted.html"><code>SuiteAborted</code></a> event.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <a name="SharedTests"></a><h2>Shared tests</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * Sometimes you may want to run the same test code on different fixture objects. In other words, you may want to write tests that are "shared"
 * by different fixture objects.
 * To accomplish this in a <code>FunSuite</code>, you first place shared tests in
 * <em>behavior functions</em>. These behavior functions will be
 * invoked during the construction phase of any <code>FunSuite</code> that uses them, so that the tests they contain will
 * be registered as tests in that <code>FunSuite</code>.
 * For example, given this stack class:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer
 * 
 * class Stack[T] {
 *
 *   val MAX = 10
 *   private var buf = new ListBuffer[T]
 *
 *   def push(o: T) {
 *     if (!full)
 *       o +: buf
 *     else
 *       throw new IllegalStateException("can't push onto a full stack")
 *   }
 *
 *   def pop(): T = {
 *     if (!empty)
 *       buf.remove(0)
 *     else
 *       throw new IllegalStateException("can't pop an empty stack")
 *   }
 *
 *   def peek: T = {
 *     if (!empty)
 *       buf(0)
 *     else
 *       throw new IllegalStateException("can't pop an empty stack")
 *   }
 *
 *   def full: Boolean = buf.size == MAX
 *   def empty: Boolean = buf.size == 0
 *   def size = buf.size
 *
 *   override def toString = buf.mkString("Stack(", ", ", ")")
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * You may want to test the <code>Stack</code> class in different states: empty, full, with one item, with one item less than capacity,
 * <em>etc</em>. You may find you have several tests that make sense any time the stack is non-empty. Thus you'd ideally want to run
 * those same tests for three stack fixture objects: a full stack, a stack with a one item, and a stack with one item less than
 * capacity. With shared tests, you can factor these tests out into a behavior function, into which you pass the
 * stack fixture to use when running the tests. So in your <code>FunSuite</code> for stack, you'd invoke the
 * behavior function three times, passing in each of the three stack fixtures so that the shared tests are run for all three fixtures.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * You can define a behavior function that encapsulates these shared tests inside the <code>FunSuite</code> that uses them. If they are shared
 * between different <code>FunSuite</code>s, however, you could also define them in a separate trait that is mixed into
 * each <code>FunSuite</code> that uses them.
 * <a name="StackBehaviors">For</a> example, here the <code>nonEmptyStack</code> behavior function (in this case, a
 * behavior <em>method</em>) is defined in a trait along with another
 * method containing shared tests for non-full stacks:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FunSuite
 * 
 * trait FunSuiteStackBehaviors { this: FunSuite =>
 * 
 *   def nonEmptyStack(createNonEmptyStack: => Stack[Int], lastItemAdded: Int) {
 * 
 *     test("empty is invoked on this non-empty stack: " + createNonEmptyStack.toString) {
 *       val stack = createNonEmptyStack
 *       assert(!stack.empty)
 *     }
 * 
 *     test("peek is invoked on this non-empty stack: " + createNonEmptyStack.toString) {
 *       val stack = createNonEmptyStack
 *       val size = stack.size
 *       assert(stack.peek === lastItemAdded)
 *       assert(stack.size === size)
 *     }
 * 
 *     test("pop is invoked on this non-empty stack: " + createNonEmptyStack.toString) {
 *       val stack = createNonEmptyStack
 *       val size = stack.size
 *       assert(stack.pop === lastItemAdded)
 *       assert(stack.size === size - 1)
 *     }
 *   }
 *   
 *   def nonFullStack(createNonFullStack: => Stack[Int]) {
 *       
 *     test("full is invoked on this non-full stack: " + createNonFullStack.toString) {
 *       val stack = createNonFullStack
 *       assert(!stack.full)
 *     }
 *       
 *     test("push is invoked on this non-full stack: " + createNonFullStack.toString) {
 *       val stack = createNonFullStack
 *       val size = stack.size
 *       stack.push(7)
 *       assert(stack.size === size + 1)
 *       assert(stack.peek === 7)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Given these behavior functions, you could invoke them directly, but <code>FunSuite</code> offers a DSL for the purpose,
 * which looks like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * testsFor(nonEmptyStack(stackWithOneItem, lastValuePushed))
 * testsFor(nonFullStack(stackWithOneItem))
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you prefer to use an imperative style to change fixtures, for example by mixing in <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> and
 * reassigning a <code>stack</code> <code>var</code> in <code>beforeEach</code>, you could write your behavior functions
 * in the context of that <code>var</code>, which means you wouldn't need to pass in the stack fixture because it would be
 * in scope already inside the behavior function. In that case, your code would look like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * testsFor(nonEmptyStack) // assuming lastValuePushed is also in scope inside nonEmptyStack
 * testsFor(nonFullStack)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The recommended style, however, is the functional, pass-all-the-needed-values-in style. Here's an example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FunSuite
 * 
 * class StackFunSuite extends FunSuite with FunSuiteStackBehaviors {
 * 
 *   // Stack fixture creation methods
 *   def emptyStack = new Stack[Int]
 *  
 *   def fullStack = {
 *     val stack = new Stack[Int]
 *     for (i <- 0 until stack.MAX)
 *       stack.push(i)
 *     stack
 *   }
 *  
 *   def stackWithOneItem = {
 *     val stack = new Stack[Int]
 *     stack.push(9)
 *     stack
 *   }
 *  
 *   def stackWithOneItemLessThanCapacity = {
 *     val stack = new Stack[Int]
 *     for (i <- 1 to 9)
 *       stack.push(i)
 *     stack
 *   }
 *  
 *   val lastValuePushed = 9
 *  
 *   test("empty is invoked on an empty stack") {
 *     val stack = emptyStack
 *     assert(stack.empty)
 *   }
 *
 *   test("peek is invoked on an empty stack") {
 *     val stack = emptyStack
 *     intercept[IllegalStateException] {

 * One thing to keep in mind when using shared tests is that in ScalaTest, each test in a suite must have a unique name.
 * If you register the same tests repeatedly in the same suite, one problem you may encounter is an exception at runtime
 * complaining that multiple tests are being registered with the same test name.
 * In a <code>FunSuite</code> there is no nesting construct analogous to <code>Spec</code>'s <code>describe</code> clause.
 * Therefore, you need to do a bit of
 * extra work to ensure that the test names are unique. If a duplicate test name problem shows up in a
 * <code>FunSuite</code>, you'll need to pass in a prefix or suffix string to add to each test name. You can pass this string
 * the same way you pass any other data needed by the shared tests, or just call <code>toString</code> on the shared fixture object.
 * This is the approach taken by the previous <code>FunSuiteStackBehaviors</code> example.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Given this <code>FunSuiteStackBehaviors</code> trait, calling it with the <code>stackWithOneItem</code> fixture, like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * testsFor(nonEmptyStack(stackWithOneItem, lastValuePushed))
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * yields test names:

 *
 * <ul>
