ScalaTest

ScalaTest is a free, open-source testing toolkit for Scala and
Java programmers.  Because different developers take different approaches to creating
software, no single approach to testing is a good fit for everyone. In light of
this reality, ScalaTest is designed to facilitate different styles of testing. ScalaTest
provides several traits that you can mix together into whatever combination makes you feel the most productive.
For some examples of the various styles that ScalaTest supports, see:

GETTING STARTED

To learn how to use ScalaTest, please
open in your browser the scaladoc documentation in the
doc directory. Look first at the documentation for trait
org.scalatest.Suite, which gives a decent intro. All the other types are
documented as well, so you can hop around to learn more.
org.scalatest.tools.Runner explains how to use the application. The
Ignore class is written in Java, and isn't currently shown in the Scaladoc.

To try it out, you can use ScalaTest to run its own tests, i.e., the tests
used to test ScalaTest itself. This command will run the GUI:

scala -classpath scalatest-<version>.jar org.scalatest.tools.Runner -p "scalatest-<version>-tests.jar" -g -s org.scalatest.SuiteSuite

This command will run and just print results to the standard output:

scala -classpath scalatest-<version>.jar org.scalatest.tools.Runner -p "scalatest-<version>-tests.jar" -o -s org.scalatest.SuiteSuite

ABOUT SCALATEST

ScalaTest was written by Bill Venners, George Berger, Josh Cough, and
other contributors starting in late 2007.  ScalaTest, which is almost
exclusively written in Scala, follows and improves upon the Java code
and design of Artima SuiteRunner, a testing tool also written
primarily by Bill Venners, starting in 2001. Over the years a few
other people contributed to SuiteRunner as well, including:

Mark Brouwer
Chua Chee Seng
Chris Daily
Matt Gerrans
John Mitchel
Frank Sommers

Several people have helped with ScalaTest, including:

Corey Haines
Colin Howe
Dianne Marsh
Joel Neely
Jon-Anders Teigen
Daniel Watson
