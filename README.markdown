This used to be: "A very slow port of NTestCaseBuilder (written in F#) to Scala."

What it has become - a small, focussed bunch of odds and ends used by SageSerpent Ltd's projects, made available for anyone to use under an MIT license.

Every now and then, new things will be added in, but there is no grand plan - although if you see something you'd like to enhance here, please do make pull requests.
