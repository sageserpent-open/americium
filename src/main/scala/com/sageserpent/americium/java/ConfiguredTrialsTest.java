/**
 * Method annotation for use by parameterised test methods run via the JUnit5
 * engine extended with {@link TrialsTestExtension}. It couples an instance
 * of {@link Trials.SupplyToSyntax} to the test method, causing the method to
 * be run repeatedly with test cases realized as arguments supplied by the
 * {@link Trials.SupplyToSyntax} instance.
 * <p>
 * Once an invocation of the test method fails, the extension will go into a
 * shrinkage mode, invoking the test method repeatedly to find a combination
 * of arguments that comprise a simpler test case.
 * <p>
 * The usage is analogous to
 * {@link org.junit.jupiter.params.ParameterizedTest}. Like that annotation,
 * the test cases are directly repeatable, for example by IntelliJ's support
 * for running individual test cases - but only up to and including the first
 * failed test invocation. Subsequent test cases resulting from shrinkage
 * require a full run over invocations to be reproduced - except for the
 * minimised failing test case, as this can be reproduced via its recipe
 * hash, consult the test console output for instructions on how to do this.
 * <p>
 * In contrast with {@link TrialsTest}, this annotation works with just one
 * field that can bring together multiple {@link Trials} instances and that
 * also implies the limit or limit strategy configuration - there is no
 * inline configuration in the annotation usage.
